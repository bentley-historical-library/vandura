          <p>The Out of the Blue series (112.4 GB) consists of three seasons of Michigan Public Media's program <title render="italic">Out of the Blue: the Michigan Difference</title>, which originally aired on the Big Ten Network from 2008-2009 to 2010-2011. Each episode (with the exception of season two, episode ten) consists of three separate segments that focus on exceptional people, research, programs, and/or events at the University of Michigan. The featured segments often include interviews with subjects, guided tours of facilities, and relevant background information. Season one (2008-2009) consists of ten episodes that cover medical advancements, new technologies, the arts, the environment and sustainability, and engineering projects at the University of Michigan. Of note is this season's coverage of the University of Michigan Museum of Art, which celebrated a grand reopening after its expansion (see episodes three and five). Season two (2009-2010) consists of fifteen episodes that document a variety of departments and people across campus. Of particular note are episodes related to sustainability efforts on campus (five), the Prison Creative Arts Project (ten), and the university's relationship with China (fourteen). Finally, season three (2010-2011) includes twelve episodes that with features on programs at the Ross School of Business, science, technology, economics, policy, arts, and minorities and outreach programs. In-depth examinations on U-M and the Peace Corps (episode six) and film-making in Michigan (episode one) will be of interest particular. The individual episodes can be downloaded from the University of Michigan's institutional repository ("Deep Blue") as QuickTime .mov files.</p>
