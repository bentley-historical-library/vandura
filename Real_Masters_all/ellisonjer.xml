      <p>Born in 1907 in Maywood, Illinois, Earl Jerome Ellison, Jr. (typically referred to as Jerry or simply Jerome) was raised by Earl, Sr. and Vera Ellison. While Ellison began his education at the University of Wisconsin in 1925, he did not receive his degree until 1930 after he had transferred to the University of Michigan for his Bachelor of Arts. He received his Masters of Science in 1966 from Southern Connecticut State College (later named Southern Connecticut State University). During his time at the University of Michigan, Ellison contributed for the student humor magazine <title render="italic">The Gargoyle</title>. </p>
      <p>After graduation from the University of Michigan, Ellison wrote and performed editorial duties for <title render="italic">Life</title> (1932-1934) and <title render="italic">Reader's Digest</title> (1935-1942). In 1942-1943 he served as the New York's <title render="italic">Liberty</title> magazine editor-in-chief. In 1943 Ellison became the managing editor of <title render="italic">Collier's</title> and served at the Bureau of Overseas Publications of the Office of War Information in 1944-1945. </p>
      <p>Also during this time period Ellison helped found <title render="italic">The Magazine of the Year</title> (which was titled both <title render="italic">'47 Magazine</title> and <title render="italic">' 48 Magazine</title> during its two year run), that he owned with Pearl S. Buck, Roger Butterfield, John Dos Passos, and John Steinbeck. The publication compiled work from a variety of writers. Ellison also contributed his works to <title render="italic">Saturday Evening Post</title> between 1948 and 1962, and edited <title render="italic">Best Articles &amp; Stories</title> between 1957 and 1961. Ellison contributed short stories and articles to <title render="italic">McCall's, Nation, New Republic, Southwest Review, University Review,</title> and other periodicals. His articles have been reprinted in more than twenty anthologies. Ellison's works include novels, such as <title render="italic">The Prisoner Ate a Hearty Breakfast, The Dam,</title> and <title render="italic">John Brown's Soul,</title> his autobiography <title render="italic">Report to the Creator,</title> as well as non-fiction works such as <title render="italic">A Serious Call to an American (R)Evolution</title> and <title render="italic">The Last Third of Life Club.</title> </p>
      <p>Ellison taught Journalism and English at a number of educational institutions: the New York University Washington Square Writer's Center (1946), Indiana University, Bloomington (1955-1960), University of Connecticut (1963-1964), and University of New Haven (1964-1974). He was also the president of the Phoenix Society, organization for the elderly.</p>
      <p>Jerome Ellison passed away in 1981. </p>
      <p>Ellison's daughter Julie Ellison is a professor at the University of Michigan. </p>

          <p>The Biographical Materials series (0.4 linear feet and 1 oversize box) documents personal aspects of Ellison's life. The incoming and outgoing correspondence typically discusses articles that Ellison submitted for publication, but also covers the topics of his studies, family life, and friends. The series includes two diaries of Ellison's that contain his writings and drawings. One document of note is a folder documenting Ellison's participation in a government experiment involving use of LSD. The series also contains photographs of Ellison and news clippings of his articles. Also found in the Biographical Materials series are oversize scrapbooks and photographs. </p>

          <p>The Writing Drafts series (1 linear foot) consists of book manuscripts, as well as poems and journal articles drafts. Many of these typewritten manuscripts are filled with handwritten corrections and notes that serve as illustrations of Ellison's writing and editing process. While mostly undated, these cover Ellison's entire career as a writer from the 1930s to the 1970s. Some of these drafts were sent to magazines and publishers, such as <title render="italic">The New Yorker</title> and Random House, and were turned down. A small number of these contain hand drawn illustrations that correspond with the work.</p>
