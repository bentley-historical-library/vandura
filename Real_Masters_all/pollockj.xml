    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>James K. Pollock was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, on May 25, 1898. He began his academic association with the University of Michigan as a student from 1916 to 1921. He received his A.B. degree in 1920 followed by the M.A. in 1921. While working on his Ph.D. degree at Harvard University, 1921-1925, he taught at Geneva College in Pennsylvania and at Ohio State University. In 1925 he accepted an instructorship in political science at the University of Michigan. He was promoted to full professor in 1934, served as departmental chairman, 1947-61, and occupied the Murfin chair from 1948 until his retirement in 1968. Although involved in many non-academic activities as well, Professor Pollock always considered himself primarily a teacher. Upon his retirement as departmental chairman, he insisted upon spending his remaining years on the faculty teaching undergraduates. In recognition of his achievements, the University of Michigan gave him its Distinguished Faculty Award in 1959.</p>
      <p>Professor Pollock's work at the University of Michigan was only one facet of a varied career, however. His interest in political parties, campaigns, and elections, both in America and in Europe, was not just academic. Over the years, his expertise in these subjects led both the state of Michigan and the U.S. government to request his advice on various occasions.</p>
      <p>In 1935 Professor Pollock accepted a request to head the newly created Michigan Civil Service Study Commission, which investigated the problem of political "spoils" and devised methods of creating an adequate personnel agency and improving working conditions for civil servants. Michigan enacted a basic civil service law in 1937, and strengthened it in 1940 despite attacks by the beneficiaries of the spoils system. In the course of the struggle, Pollock was instrumental in helping to found the Michigan Merit System Association, designed to improve and protect civil service in Michigan. He maintained an active interest in the system throughout his life, and for his work he has been termed "the father of Michigan's civil service."</p>
      <p>However, it was Pollock's interest in foreign political systems, particularly in those of Germany, which was to dominate his career. His interest began in the 1920s, and in 1928 a grant from the Social Science Research Council financed a trip to Europe which resulted in studies of parties and elections in Great Britain, France, Ireland, and Germany. Professor Pollock's interest became increasingly focused on Germany, and as a result of his work on German elections, the Plebiscite Commission of the League of Nations chose him as the American observer at the Saar plebiscite in 1935, in which the Saarlanders voted to reunite with Germany.</p>
      <p>Professor Pollock's status as an expert on German affairs led the U.S. government to tap him for wartime activities. He lectured at the Provost Marshal General's School at Fort Custer in 1942-43, and participated in both the Judge Advocate General's School and the Civil Affairs Training School at Michigan from 1943 to 1945. In addition, from 1941 to 1943 Pollock gave weekly news analyses and speeches on various Detroit radio stations. Throughout the war, Professor Pollock wrote prolifically on the topic of Germany, the question of her responsibility and guilt, and the problem of how a defeated Germany was to be treated following the war. Although Pollock strongly condemned the Nazis and did not hesitate to insist that the Germans themselves were responsible for Hitler, he rejected the ideas, current among many in the U.S., that all Germans were Nazis and that Germany should be destroyed territorially after her defeat. Pollock believed that a postwar democratic state in Germany was possible, but insisted it could only be built by the Germans themselves. To this end, he offered various concrete proposals regarding the occupation of Germany, all of them involving the direct participation of non-Nazi Germans in the government at an early stage, and geared toward the most rapid reconstruction possible.</p>
      <p>The constructive nature of Professor Pollock's approach no doubt had much to do with the U.S. government's request in 1945 that he serve as special adviser to General Lucius D. Clay, deputy governor of the American zone in Germany. Clay faced enormous problems resulting from lack of coordination and communication between the zones, as well as from lack of local government within the American zone. Pollock's assignment was to develop a political and governmental framework for the zone. This was done by dividing the zone into four Lander or states, each with a Minister-President at its head, supported by a skeletal bureaucracy. To coordinate and supervise these state governments, the American Military Government established a Regional Government Coordinating Office (RGCO) at Stuttgart, with Pollock as its director. In addition, a German counterpart called the Landerrat or Council of States was established, consisting of the Minister-Presidents, their supporting personnel and a central secretariat. The Landerrat met regularly in Stuttgart and, with American counseling, established patterns for regional and local government, helped to recreate systems of justice and security, and made preparations for drafting constitutions for future self-government. Pollock deliberately remained in the background, encouraging the Landerrat to be as self-sufficient as possible, with the result that a much more rapid political revival occurred than in the other zones.</p>
      <p>Professor Pollock returned to Ann Arbor in September 1946, but went back to Germany in 1947 and 1948 on observatory missions for the Office of Military Government in Germany, United States Zone. In 1950, following the unification of the non-Soviet zones of occupation and the enactment of the Basic Law of 1949, the cornerstone of the Federal Republic, he conducted a fact-finding mission for the United States High Commissioner for Germany. Professor Pollock was formally honored by both the U.S. and German governments for his work with the Landerrat. In 1946 President Truman conferred upon him the U.S. government's highest civilian award, the Medal of Merit, and in 1956 and 1959, respectively, the German government awarded him the Grand Cross Order of Merit and the Knight Commander's Cross.</p>
      <p>During the postwar years, Professor Pollock was active in a number of organizations (particularly the Franz Lieber Foundation) which promoted better understanding between Germans and Americans, and which were dedicated to keeping the cause of a unified Germany in the public eye of this country. In addition, Pollock expanded his duties in the Political Science department at the university, and became involved with the American Political Science Association and the International Political Science Association, serving as president of the former in 1950 and of the latter from 1955 to 1958.</p>
      <p>In 1947, Pollock was appointed a member of the Committee on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, better known as the Hoover Commission, which had just been created by Congress. Its purpose was to attempt to bring the machinery of the executive branch of the federal government back within the control of the president, increasing its efficiency and its responsiveness at the same time. Pollock served on the committee until 1949, and remained concerned with these problems throughout the 1950s. The final report of the Hoover Commission made a request for a "continuing agency" to deal with the problems in this area, and in 1959, after several intermediate commissions, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations was created by act of Congress. Pollock served as vice-chairman of the Commission from 1959 to 1961. Professor Pollock's interest during the 1950s in the relationship between federal and state governments also led to his one attempt at elective office; he was elected as a delegate of the Republican party to the Michigan Constitutional Convention in 1961.</p>
      <p>Professor Pollock retired as departmental chairman in 1961, and retired from the University of Michigan in 1968. Unfortunately, his desire to pursue further such various topics such as the reform of state government, the reorganization of the federal executive and the problems of governments abroad was cut short by his death a few months later, on October 4, 1968.</p>

      <p>The James K. Pollock papers represent an accumulation of files from a lifetime of academic teaching and research and an extraordinary number of public service responsibilities to both his state and his nation. The files within the collection fall into two categories: types of document (such as correspondence, speeches and writings, visual materials, etc.) and files resulting from a specific activity or position (such as his work as delegate to the Michigan Constitutional Convention or his service with the Office of the Military Government in Germany after World War II).</p>
      <p>The collection is large and of a complicated arrangement because of Pollock's many activities. When received in 1969, the files were maintained as received; very little processing was done to the collection so that an inventory to the papers could be quickly prepared. The order of material is that devised by James K. Pollock and his secretarial staff in the U-M Department of Political Science. Recognizing the anomalies within the order of the collection, the library made the decision to list the contents to the collection while at the same time preparing a detailed card file index (by box and folder number, i.e. 16-8) to significant correspondents and subjects. While there was much to be said for this method of preparing a finding aid expeditiously, it also covered up some problems in arrangement. Thus series and subseries of materials are not always grouped together as they were created by Pollock. Files on the Hoover Commission and the Michigan Constitutional Convention, for example, come before Pollock's work in Germany after the war. In 1999, effort was made to resolve some of the inconsistencies and obvious misfilings of the first inventory but because of the numbering system used in 1969 and the card index prepared for the files, there are still some problems. Researchers should be alert to these difficulties and take time to examine different parts of the collection for material on a similar topic.</p>

          <p>Correspondence (1912-1968; 26 linear ft.) is the largest series in the collection. The files are broken down into broad chronological subseries though there is frequent overlapping of dates depending upon whether an older file was carried over into a subsequent subseries because still of current use to Pollock or filing error. The researcher should consult the card index of Pollock correspondents if interested in a specific individual or organization. Also to be noted, this series includes more than correspondence. Depending upon the file heading, there could be reports, memoranda, and other kinds of documents. Correspondents include other political scientists, state government administrators, politicians, national figures, journalists, and those with whom he worked while stationed in Germany.</p>

          <p>Organizational Affiliations and Professional Interests (1935-1968; 7 linear ft.) is a topical file maintained by Pollock for his political science organizational involvement and other miscellaneous professional interests. Included are extensive files for the American Political Science Association, the Governmental Affairs Institute, and the International Political Science Association. Pollock had been a participant in the foundation of the IPSA in 1949, and served as its president from 1955 to 1958. Both the files of this organization and the correspondence between Pollock and its other leaders, particularly in Europe, provide insight into the varying concepts of political science in different countries and the practical uses to which it might be put. The researcher should note that there might be additional materials on these and other organizations in the Correspondence series.</p>

          <p>James K. Pollock was widely respected for his knowledge of the workings of government on both the state and national level. Because of that he was selected to work on specific problems of government or with specific agencies. Files from these activities, most of which took place after World War II, have been grouped together in the series, Governmental Public Service (1948-1968; 18 linear ft.). This series does not include Pollock's work in Germany after the war. Nor does it include his service with the Michigan Civil Service Study Commission which was a series of files donated to the library many years prior to the major accessioning of Pollock papers in 1969. The subseries under Governmental Public Service consist of Hoover Commission, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, the Michigan Constitutional Convention of 1962-1963, the Citizens Conference on State Legislatures, and the Governor's Special Commission on Legislative Compensation. There is also a miscellaneous topical subseries on issues of congressional organization and reapportionment, among other issues.</p>

            <p>The largest subseries under the Germany series relates to Pollock's responsibility with Office of the Military Government (U.S.) in the period of 1945-1946 and his role as official observer and member of fact-finding missions to Germany in 1947, 1948, and 1950. As a scholar as well as a participant, Pollock was careful in recording his observations and activities. He maintained a valuable diary for the period of 1945-1946 and 1948 and was diligent in preserving the documentation that crossed his desk - reports, memoranda, meeting materials, and speeches. The importance of the diary was readily recognized by German scholars. In 1994, Ingrid Krüger-Bulcke published Besatzune und Staatsaufbau nach 1945 which is a transcript of Pollock's "Occupation Diary" and his private correspondence with his wife and some of his colleagues in the period of 1945 to 1948. A positive microfilm of this diary is also available. The library also has a negative microfilm for the entire subseries originally created for a researcher.</p>
            <p>The subseries also contains much material on the proceedings of the Länderrat, including protocols of all of its meetings through 1948. There is also material on organization, proposals, the results of actions taken, and relations with the Regional Government Coordinating Office. Other files pertain to the United States zonal government as a whole and its relations with the other zones. There are further files on the economic situation in Germany, the progress of denazification, and reports on the conferences of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Extensive files of correspondence from this period is available with General Lucius Clay, Robert Murphy, and John McCloy. (A microfilm negative of this entire series was produced fora researcher.

          <p>European Election Studies (1.5 linear ft.; 1920s-1957) is a series of research data and other materials from Pollock's study of different French and English elections. Most of the results of these studies were published in professional journals. Pollock's German election files have been maintained in the Germany series. This series includes extensive data on French elections from the 1920s to the 1950s with special emphasis on the 1930s, and British elections from 1918 to the late 1960s including complete data on parliamentary elections from 1918 to 1935 and 1945 to 1950, and special reports on party strength, campaign literature, proportional representation and electoral districts.</p>

          <p>University of Michigan is divided into subseries. The first relates to administrative matters within the department of political science and to Pollock's other activities at the University. This subseries covers the period of 1931 to 1967 and measures 0.2 linear feet. Most of Pollock's University of Michigan activities are best documented in the different chronological correspondence files. The second and largest is comprised of Course Materials (3.7 lin. ft.; 1924-1967) is further arranged by course number and by topic. The papers arranged by course number (2.2 linear feet) are in ascending order and include many handwritten notes for course lectures, bibliographies, reading lists and schedules, exams and weekly questions, some student papers, published papers by Pollock and others, and documents used in class. Papers arranged by topic (1.5 linear feet) relate to many facets of political science, both national and international. Most extensive is the set of papers related to German government, and of particular interest are the records related to the trip Pollock took to Germany with other professors and academics in 1934, and the field survey he conducted with students on the 1953 Budestag elections in Germany.</p>

          <p>The Personal/Miscellaneous (2 linear ft.; 1919-ca. 1960s) series consists of a subseries of personal correspondence covering the period from July 1945 to August 1946, when Pollock served as special adviser to General Lucius D. Clay, deputy governor of the American zone. The letters are written by Pollock to his wife, Agnes, and occasionally to his mother and sister, first from Berlin (location of the Central Control Council, a joint council made up of the military leaders of the four occupying powers) and later from Stuttgart (where the RGCO was located, and where the Länderrat met). The letters supplement Pollock's occupation diary for this period (found in Box 58) by providing a more personal perspective on his activities. They contain summaries of and observations about Pollock's work for the American Military Government, descriptions of the places he visited, and information about the practicalities of daily life and his feelings about being away from his family. There is also correspondence from Pollock's later visits to Germany in 1947 and 1948. The letters from his 1947 visit (Jan.-March) are particularly valuable because no occupation diary exists from this period. A folder of miscellaneous correspondence contains some letters from 1941, plus some written during later visits to Germany in 1950 and 1956. The scarcity of letters during these later trips is explained by the death of Pollock's wife in October 1948.</p>
          <p>This series also contains a miscellanea of personal materials, programs from public appearances, address books, presentation copies of some of the books given to Pollock throughout his career, and some of the student essays that he wrote while a student at Harvard and the University of Michigan. Included as well is a transcript of the oral history interview with Pollock conducted by Sidney Fine and relating to civil service reform in Michigan and Pollock's relationship to Governor Frank Murphy.</p>
