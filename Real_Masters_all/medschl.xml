      <p>While the University of Michigan's charters of 1817 and 1837 both called for the inclusion of medical education within the curriculum, no action was taken to carry out this mandate until 1848. On January 19 of that year the regents appropriated funds for the construction of a building to house a new Medical Department. In the fall of 1850, when the building was completed, the first courses in medicine were taught.</p>
      <p>The two available faculty members offered a six month course of study. Most material was taught through lectures. Ward rounds were perfunctory and no laboratory courses were required. A strict set of prerequisites for admission to the program existed, but in practice any student was admitted and then given up to two years to complete the prerequisite education. Administration was extremely limited. The "Rules of Government of the Medical College," adopted in July 1850, required the medical faculty to annually elect one of their number "president." By 1853, the title "president" had been superseded by that of "dean."</p>
      <p>Throughout the nineteenth century the school grew and matured. The period of study lengthened, the number and type of courses grew, the quality of the students improved, and the administration of the college became more sophisticated. The length of study was increased repeatedly. In 1877-1878, the regents required of any student wishing to receive a medical degree one full academic year of study. At the same time an optional three year program was established. In 1880-1881, the three-year program was made mandatory, and in 1890-1891, the mandatory program was lengthened to four years.</p>
      <p>The expanded amount of training naturally involved an increasing number of courses. Courses changed not only in number, however, but also in character. While lectures remained an important part of medical education, they were supplemented by mandatory laboratory courses and extensive rounds. The first mandatory laboratory course, anatomy, was initiated in 1852-1853. It was followed by qualitative chemistry, urine analysis, and histological work (microscopic analysis). In 1856-1857, the school's perfunctory rounds were superseded by more satisfactory clinics. The construction of the first university hospital in 1869, substantially increased in size in 1876 and again in 1879, gave students the opportunity to observe a variety of injuries and diseases.</p>
      <p>Admission standards also changed. In 1874, written examinations were required of all candidates. In 1875-1876, candidates claiming other educational work were required to submit credentials. In 1903 a high school diploma was made mandatory for admission, and in 1912 a de facto rule of three years earlier requiring all candidates to have completed two years of college was stated explicitly. The first minimum grade point average appears to have been established in 1921.</p>
      <p>The administration of the school remained vested in elected deans until 1891. In that year the regents amended their bylaws, giving themselves exclusive power to appoint deans. The effect of this decision on the Medical School was to strengthen the dean's position. Between 1850 and 1891 seven men served thirteen terms of office as dean, the average term in office lasting slightly more than three years. The regents' first appointed Dean of the Medical School, Victor C. Vaughan, held the position for thirty years.</p>
      <p>Vaughan's retirement, in 1921, saw the Medical School at a highwater mark. Vaughan himself had been a distinguished researcher, author, and educator, as well as a past president of the American Medical Association. He had first come to Michigan in 1874 as a student, and joined the faculty of the Medical School in 1879. He had attracted to Michigan a distinguished faculty, given the school a reputation for educational innovation, and left it one of the nation's pre-eminent medical colleges.</p>
      <p>While Michigan remained a leader in medical education after Vaughan's retirement, the faculty was divided by a bitter factional dispute centering around Vaughan's successor as dean, Hugh Cabot. Cabot, a Harvard educated surgeon who had served at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1902 to 1919, proved unable to deal with the situation. Dissension reached the point at which several key faculty members believed the school's continuing success depended upon Cabot's removal as dean. In February 1930 the regents "...in the interests of greater harmony in the Medical School," removed Cabot from his position as dean and authorized the president of the university to appoint a committee of five to direct the affairs of the school.</p>
      <p>The Executive Committee, consisted of Frederick G. Novy, chair, James D. Bruce, Harley A. Jaynes, Udo J. Wile, and Arthur C. Curtis. It governed the Medical School until 1933, when one of its number, Frederick Novy, was appointed dean. Novy, a contemporary of Vaughan's, was close to retirement and it seems clear that his appointment was a final honor bestowed upon a senior and distinguished faculty member rather than a permanent selection. Despite the selection of Novy as dean, the Executive Committee continued to play an important role in the administration of the school.</p>
      <p>In 1935, a permanent replacement for Cabot was appointed. Perhaps reacting to both the failure of the outsider Cabot and the success of the University of Michigan schooled Vaughan, an internal candidate was chosen as dean. Albert C. Furstenberg had received virtually all of his medical experience at Michigan. The university had awarded him his medical degree in 1915, and he subsequently joined the Medical School's faculty. Furstenberg's appointment did little to rein in the virtually independent faculty. The Executive Committee continued to meet regularly, and the various departments, which had always acted with independence, now possessed virtual sovereignty. Throughout his tenure as dean, Furstenberg exercised his authority with needed diplomacy.</p>
      <p>After the conclusion of the Second World War the Medical School, like the rest of the university, experienced rapidly increasing demands for service. Most important were repeated requests by the state legislature that the school expand to increase the number of doctors available in the state. Coupled with this request were other requests that the number of out-of-state students be reduced or eliminated entirely. From a 1940 base of 120 members per class, the numbers of students in each class slowly increased to 165 in 1951. In 1952, the opening of new physical facilities allowed class size to increase to 204. This number slowly increased for the next thirty years, reaching approximately 235. The school also voluntarily imposed a drastic limit on the number of out-of-state students it accepted.</p>
      <p>To meet the increasing demands for education, and to staff a vastly increased research program, faculty size grew dramatically. In 1940, the Medical School had approximately 140 faculty members. In 1971, there were 578 faculty members. Physical facilities also grew. Eight major construction projects were undertaken between 1947 and 1955. Between 1955 and 1970 another fourteen projects were undertaken, including the Kresge Research addition (1964), Medical Science II (1969), Towsley Center (1970) and C.S. Mott Children's Hospital (1970). Throughout the 1970s planning was undertaken for the construction of a new University Hospital to replace the often renovated structure constructed in 1925. The Replacement Hospital Project dominated thinking throughout the decade.</p>
      <p>Expanded physical facilities proved inadequate to deal with the complex education needs of the Medical School. To better meet these needs, the school entered into agreements with several affiliated or "core" hospitals. St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Veterans Administration Hospital (Ann Arbor), Wayne County General Hospital, and Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit), all formally agreed to offer clinical educational resources to medical students from the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Governing the vastly expanded Medical School became an increasingly complex problem. In 1940, administration consisted of the dean, the secretary of the faculty, the three member Executive Committee, and a registrar or recorder. In 1947, the first associate dean, Maurice H. Seevers, was appointed. Throughout the remainder of Dean Furstenberg's term of office he was aided by either an associate or assistant dean.</p>
      <p>In 1959, Furstenberg was succeeded as dean by William N. Hubbard, Jr. Hubbard had received his medical training in New York City, and had continued to reside there, serving as an associate dean of the New York University College of Medicine, until his appointment as dean in Ann Arbor. He quickly expanded the administrative structure of his predecessor. In 1960-1961, he appointed a new assistant dean, and added three new assistants to the dean, one of them being J. A. Diana who was responsible for business operations. In 1961-1962, he revived the title associate dean, unused since 1951, and added that position to the new positions now in place. Among Hubbard's appointments to these many positions were Alexander Barry (1963-1964), Fred Hodges (1965-1966), Robert A. Green (1967-1968), and George R. DeMuth (1968-1969).</p>
      <p>In 1969, a sweeping reform occurred in the administration of the entire hospital hill complex. The University Hospital Study and Advisory Committee, chaired by Fedele F. Fauri (commonly referred to as the Fauri Committee), and appointed by University President Robben Fleming, recommended combining the administration of the hospital and the medical school under a single person, the Director of the University of Michigan Medical Center. This recommendation, and several others, were carried out by the regents on February 21, 1969. The position was given to Hubbard, who also continued to serve as dean of the Medical School.</p>
      <p>In 1970, Hubbard was replaced as dean by John A. Gronvall. Gronvall also became director of the Medical Center. Gronvall, like Hubbard, continued to modify the administrative structure of the Medical School. In 1972-1973, he appointed Thomas J. Herrmann as associate dean, and added two new assistant deans to the school, one of them Charles L. Votaw. In subsequent years, Gronvall recognized the importance of the various affiliated hospitals by appointing separate assistant deans to oversee educational activities in each of them. While overseeing the modification of the administrative structure of the Medical School itself, Gronvall also took part in the dismantling of much of the Fauri Committee's work. Dissatisfaction with the way the administrative structures proposed by the committee actually worked led, in December 1974, to a reorganization of the entire administrative structure. The Medical Center as an administrative entity was abolished, and Dean Gronvall was no longer required to exercise direct administrative oversight of hospital operations.</p>
      <p>In 1982, Dean Gronvall resigned from his position as dean. Peter A. Ward served as interim dean from 1982 to 1985. Seizing in part on the fact that the Medical School was administered by an interim dean, university president Harold Shapiro recommended to the regents in 1983 the creation of a new office of vice provost for medical affairs. The dean of the Medical School and the executive director of the University Hospital would report to the new vice provost who in turn would report to the vice president for academic affairs and provost. This arrangement was designed to provide a single node of responsibility for the Medical Center, while maintaining the Medical School within the overall academic structure of the university. On April 1, 1984, George D. Zuidema was appointed as vice provost for medical affairs.</p>
      <p>In 1985, Joseph E. Johnson was named as dean of the Medical School. Johnson remained until 1990, after which Giles Bole served first as acting dean, then as dean, beginning in 1991. In 1994, Zuidema retired as vice provost for medical affairs. At that time the position was reevaluated and reconfigured as vice provost for health affairs. On July 1, 1994, Rhetaugh Dumas was appointed to the re-designated vice provost position.</p>
      <p>In 1996 Giles Bole resigned as dean and was succeeded by Lorris Betz as interim dean. In 1998 Allen S. Lichter succeeded Betz as interim dean before being appointed dean. A new position was created in 1997, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs. Gilbert Omenn was named to this new position in September 1997.</p>

They include 323 linear feet of material, ten oversized volumes and six oversized folders of miscellaneous documents. The records include dean's correspondence and subject files, executive committee minutes, faculty minutes, annual reports of departments, school accreditation and review files, a variety of special reports and studies, and extensive files on the Replacement Hospital Project (Taubman Center). The record group also contains photo prints depicting faculty, students and facilities, including a remarkable series of photographs taken by J. Jefferson Gibson ca. 1893.</p>
      <p>The Medical School records have been organized into five subgroups: Dean's Records, Subordinate Administrative Officers, Faculty Records, Audio-Visual Materials, and Miscellaneous records. Within each subgroup there are a number of series and these series may be further subdivided to reflect the date span of the records received in each accession.</p>
      <p>The Medical School records have been received in several accessions and the physical arrangement of the records (the number order of the boxes) reflects the various installments in which they were received. The accessions sometimes reflected the tenure of a particular dean or other administrator, but frequently appear to have been somewhat arbitrary transfers of files. Records from individual subgroups, series and subseries often continue across multiple accessions--sometimes with consecutive date ranges, but often with overlapping date spans.</p>
      <p>In this finding aid the records are described in their intellectual order -- like subgroups and series are brought together irrespective of the particular accession in which they were received. As a result, in the detailed contents listing the box number order will not always be consecutive.</p>

          <p>The largest subgroup in the Medical School record group is the Dean's Records, dating from 1915 to 1996. The Dean's Records have been divided into six series: Committee and Council Records, Executive Committee, Correspondence Files, Departmental Files, Administrative Records, and Miscellaneous Files. Filing practices varied over the years with the result that there may be gaps in some series. The Correspondence series, for example, has no material for the years 1960-1989. Presumably, items that had been filed as correspondence were filed under another category for those years.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Committee and Council Records Series (1930-1996) consists of various committees and councils that reported to the dean, were appointed by the dean, or on which the dean served or held an interest. The subseries is further subdivided by time spans reflecting materials received in various accessions. Records of a particular committee may extend over several of the accessions. Files of individual committees may include minutes correspondence and other material.</p>
            <p>The arrangement, established by the Dean's office, of the 1930-1980 subseries (the original accessions) is a complicated one. Committees are arranged alphabetically by the source of their appointment. Thus committee records are divided by those committees appointed solely within the Medical School (Ad Hoc and Standing), committees appointed jointly by the Medical Center (Medical School and University Hospital), committees appointed by senior university administrators, and non-university committees, usually state or national committees in which the Medical School participated. In later accessions the distinguishing categories were abandoned. The records of the Executive Committee constitute a separate subseries.</p>
            <p>Among the most informative records in the Committee and Council Series are minutes of the Dean's Advisory Council, filed under the Medical School Standing Committees. The Dean's Advisory Council is composed of the heads of the various departments. Its minutes are generally complete between 1959 and 1977 and are remarkably informative and frank. Other significant committee files include: Building Committee, Interim Review and Promotion Board, 1930-1975; the Biomedical Research Council, 1974-1984; the Computer Advisory Committee, 1977-1983; Michigan Association for Regional Medical Planning, 1972-1973; and the Wayne County General Hospital Senior Advisory Group, 1965-1972.</p>

            <p>The records of the Medical School Executive Committee include a run of that body's minutes, from its founding in 1930 through 2000. The records also include two small files relating to appointments and promotions and committee retreats. The primary record of the school's governing body, the minutes provide documentation of a wide array of policies, programs and issues.</p>
            <p>As the School's presumptive court of last appeal, the Medical School Executive Committee routinely decided whether students should be dismissed from the school, or allowed re-admittance after a dismissal. Moreover, it heard students' appeals of these decisions. Similarly, it had final say over faculty appointments, promotion, and tenure decisions, and also heard departmental chair appeals of negative decisions on any of these matters. Because all of the above issues were carefully documented with significant amounts of personal information, the Medical School Executive Committee records are under extended restrictions.</p>

            <p>The Correspondence Series served as the Medical School's general file from 1915 until 1959. It includes correspondence, committee records, and reports. Generally it is arranged alphabetically by calendar year, although variant filing schemes were used prior to 1921. Inconsistent rules for alphabetizing were used. For example, correspondence with university president Alexander Ruthven was filed under "P" in 1948, but "R" in 1950. Similar confusion over filing rules exist elsewhere in the correspondence series, although the years just after World War II is where this most often occurs. While filing generally was done by name of title of correspondent, or by the name of the internal committee, a few subject headings do exist. Most frequent are "Budget," "Promotions" (sometimes filed as "Promotions and Appointments" or simply "Appointments") and "Doctor Locations." Promotions is valuable for tracing the careers of individual faculty members. "Doctor Location" is an unusual file used for letters written to the Medical School by physicians wishing to sell their practice or seeking an assistant, or communities seeking to attract a doctor to their location.</p>
            <p>The Dean's Correspondence Series, 1915-1959, was appraised at the item level. A written set of criteria was established to determine which material should be retained, and which eliminated. In general, all substantive correspondence, all minutes and reports, and re-occurring folders such as Budget and Promotions were retained. Material eliminated included requests for general information or specific forms, requests for interpretations of the admissions criteria, requests regarding the availability of particular courses (particularly during the summer session), announcements of available internships, non-substantive alumni correspondence particularly in regards to the mechanics of reunions, notices (of staff vacations, temporary vacancies, etc.), referral and consultation letters, invitations, regrets and acknowledgments, letters regarding travel information, particularly hotel reservations, train and plane schedules, and non-Michigan doctor location letters. In general non-substantive documents, including routine correspondence, as well as minor financial documentation or authorizations, were eliminated. Student records were separated from the collection at the request of the Medical School, and returned to them for inclusion in student files. Because the correspondence is arranged alphabetically, in general, there are no separate file folder headings by name of individual or title. Exceptions to this rule were made if the quantity of material was sufficient to justify a folder. All such folders are noted in the finding aid, but the absence of such a folder should not be taken to mean the absence of correspondence by a person.</p>
            <p>An addition the Correspondence series (2.5 linear feet) was received as part of the 2002 accession of Medical School records. Covering the years 1990-1997, it is a chronological file of incoming and outgoing correspondence of dean Giles Bole (acting dean July-December, 1990, dean 1991-1996) and interim dean A. Lorris Betz (1996-1998). As it includes everything that required the dean's signature, including sensitive student and personnel matters, this series falls under those extended restrictions.</p>

            <p>Departmental Files consist of annual reports prepared by each department for the dean, correspondence between the dean and departments on topics ranging from budget and personnel matters to research projects. The series is divided into subseries which reflect the various accessions in which the records were received: Departmental Annual and Other Special Reports, 1959-1979; 1956-1984; 1977-1990; and 1978, 1981-1996. Files on particular topics often extend over multiple subseries.</p>

              <p>Departmental Annual and Other Special Reports dates from 1959 to 1979. In the late 1950s the practice of requiring the various departments in the Medical School to submit an annual report to the dean was resumed. The resulting reports are arranged alphabetically by year. Some years also have miscellaneous special reports written by the departments for the dean.</p>

              <p>The 1978, 1981-1996 Departmental Files subseries (2002 Accession, 10 linear feet) specifically documents the dean's interactions with each of the individual departments of the Medical School. The series includes records from the tenures of dean Giles Bole (1991-1996) and interim dean A. Lorris Betz (1996-1998), as well as files created during the tenure of dean Joseph Johnson III that were retained by Bole when he became interim dean in 1990. The highlight of the subseries is its detailed information on the departments, including their budget, hiring, promotion, and space allocation processes; their growth and/or struggles with cost containment and the move to managed care; and their political maneuverings, collaborations, and occasional tensions with other departments and units of the university.</p>

            <p>The Administrative Files Series of the Dean's Records subgroup began personal file kept by Deans Hubbard and Gronvall but overtime became a much more inclusive topical file. The series is subdivided into several chronological subseries reflecting the various accessions in which the records were received: 1950-1979 (original accessions) 1967-1982 (1987 accession); 1959-1984 (1990 accession); 1960-1988 (1990 #2 accession); 1960-1990 (1997 accession); and 1983-1998 (2002 accession). Within each of these subseries, the records are arranged alphabetically. There is considerable overlap in the date spans of the subseries and subject files often extend over several subseries.</p>
            <p>The 1950-1979 subseries of the Administrative Files series of the Dean's Records subgroup Correspondence with all senior university officials after 1959 which had previously been filed in the Dean’s Correspondence series.</p>
            <p>The Administrative Files, 1967-1982 subseries (1987 Accession) includes extensive files on the school accreditation surveys, 1967 and 1975, and the Replacement Hospital Project, 1975-1982.</p>
            <p>The 1959-1985 Administrative Files (1990 Accession) are arranged alphabetically and consist of materials created and received by the dean on various subjects. Committee files within the series contain materials on policies and procedures and some summaries of committee actions. The 1959-1994 (1990 #2 Accession, 3.5 linear feet) contains miscellaneous files from the deanship of John Gronvall.</p>
            <p>The Administrative Files 1960-1990 subseries (1997 Accession) is strongest for the period 1985-1989. The files, which document the many activities of the Medical School, include information on several initiatives such as the development of the M-CARE health maintenance organization (HMO), and the creation of the vice provost for medical affairs position. The affiliated hospitals are also well documented, particularly the severing of ties with Westland Medical Center.</p>
            <p>The 1983-1998 subseries of the Administrative Files (2002 accession, 25 linear feet, is comprised of the central subject files of the Medical School's Dean's Office. The subseries includes records from the tenures of dean Giles Bole (1990-1996) and interim dean A. Lorris Betz (1996-1998). It also includes earlier material, retained by Bole, handed down from the previous Medical School dean Joseph Johnson III. The series documents the major topics and issues of the era, such as the changing nature of medical education (as evidenced by a major curriculum revision covered in the files), and the increasing influence of HMOs and other managed care plans on medicine (as seen in the many files covering topics such as 'Faculty Group Practice,' 'Medical Service Plan,' and 'Networking.') Other issues reflect concerns of the larger university setting, such as the files on the indirect costs of research and implementation of Value Centered Management. Of note is the file "definitions" which is helpful in making distinctions between Medical Center, Hospital, and Medical School.</p>
            <p>When looking for administrative files related to the offices of Assistant and Associate Deans that were kept by the Dean's Office, researchers should note that material in the series will usually be found under the name of the administrative office. These offices include Faculty Affairs, Clinical Affairs, Medical Education, and Research. Two major exceptions are Graduate Medical Education, which was located within Research, and Minority Affairs, which was located within the Academic Programs office. It should also be noted that during the years covered by this series, the Academic Programs Office was transformed into the Student Programs Office. While the main run of the series retains the 'Academic Programs' designation, the files that have been restricted due to sensitive personnel and/or student information are filed under 'Student Programs.'</p>

            <p>The series of Miscellaneous Files (3.5 linear feet, 1968-1975, 1980-1996) includes records from the tenures of interim dean Peter Ward (1982-1985), dean Joseph Johnson III (1985-1990), dean Giles Bole (1990-1996) and interim dean A. Lorris Betz (1996-1998), as well as files created during earlier deanships that were retained by Ward when he became interim dean. There are three major components of this series: records of a Medical School task force headed by A. Lorris Betz charged to improve communications in the school, records relating to the Medical School's efforts to assess its climate for diversity, and records pertaining to the process the Medical School undergoes every several years to receive re-accreditation by the American Association of Medical Colleges' Liaison Committee on Medical Education. This last topic is also covered in the Administrative series of subject files.</p>

            <p>In 2008 and 2010, the Bentley Library received small accessions of digital materials (from the Office of the Provost and the Office of the Medical School Dean, respectively) related to the Medical School. These materials comprise a new series, Allen Lichter, Dean 1998-2006, within the Dean's Records subgroup. Content includes a "State of the School" address delivered by Dean Allen S. Lichter at Dow Auditorium in the Towsley Center on May 25, 2004 (with presentation slides and video footage of the event) and email correspondence from 1999-2006. This correspondence deals with faculty recruiting, professional medical boards, event logistics, and communication with donors, Medical School faculty, and administration.</p>

          <p>The Subordinate Administrative Officers subgroup, 1929-1998, is divided into fifteen series, one for each subordinate administrator whose papers are located within the subgroup. Most often these individuals held the rank of associate dean. The subgroup is incomplete in that all senior administrators within the school are not represented. It is also incomplete in that the records of the named administrators are not whole. Generally, the files located in this subgroup are of residual, rather than essential, documents. Unless otherwise noted, each series is arranged alphabetically by subject.</p>

            <p>Associate Dean Alexander Barry's Series (1961-1969) consists largely of construction records for projects built during his years of service. A great deal of the correspondence is with J. A. Diana, who seems to have been responsible for day-to-day oversight of the construction projects.</p>

            <p>Associate Dean Thomas J. Hermann's Series is divided into two subseries. The first subseries (1970-1977) is composed of committee records. Of particular interest are the files of various departmental review and search committees. Included in this category are Anatomy (1972-1973; 1977), Anesthesiology (1973-1975), Biochemistry (1977), Dermatology (1972-1975), Internal Medicine (1973-1975), Neurology (1977) and Otorhinolaryngology (1977). The second subseries (1960-1974) is made up of administrative records. Particularly rich subjects include the Cooperative Michigan Primary Care Preceptor Program (1972-1974), affiliated hospitals (1960-1973, primarily 1969-1973), and the Postgraduate Medicine Program (1969-1972).</p>

            <p>Fred J. Hodges was an assistant to the dean. Hodges bore primary responsibility for the administration of the Michigan Association for Regional Medical Programs (MARMP). These particular documents have been transferred to the Dean's Records Subgroup, Committee and Council Series, where they supplemented the extensive MARMP policy records already found there. The papers that remain in Hodges' series (1960-1972) are primarily personal documents, including a set of memos Hodges sent to the dean (1966-1972).</p>

            <p>Walter G. Rice was the director of the Office of Medical Center Planning, an organization given strong impetus by the Fauri Committee Report. The Rice series is divided into two subseries, an Administrative File (1964-1975) and a Reference File (1961-1975). Of the two, the Reference File is particularly interesting. Arranged chronologically, it gathers together in one place reports, studies, and publications relating to the development of the Medical Center as a whole, as well as documents considering specific developments and problems on hospital hill.</p>

            <p>Associate Dean James A. Taren served as Associate Dean for Educational Affairs. This series (1943-1982) is an artificial one, created to hold long runs of student related materials. In particular the series contains the "Class of" file and student handbooks. The "Class of" material (1943-1944; 1951-1982) contains material on each medical school class. Arranged by class year, most files include a class roster, list of internship assignments, and graduation day exercise material. Student handbooks are official publications of the Medical School giving detailed information about what is expected of the student in a particular year of medical study.</p>

            <p>Charles A. Votaw was Associate Dean for Curriculum. His series (1929-1977, primarily 1950-1977) has been divided into three subseries: Committee Records, Medical Examination Questions, and Administrative Files. The Committee Records (1948-1977) have extensive material from the Academic Programs Committee (1964-1977), including records of that committee's chairman, James A. Taren (1975-1977), and the Curriculum Committee (1948-1963). The Medical Examination Questions (1929-1974) consists of copies of the tests given to medical students. The Administrative Files include particularly detailed information about affiliated hospitals.</p>

          <p>The Faculty Records Subgroup is most notable for an extensive run of Faculty and Executive Faculty minutes (1850-1979). This subgroup also contains records of the annual faculty retreat (1965-1979) where major changes in the Medical School were often discussed at length. There are also minutes of meetings of the Junior Medical Faculty (1956-1968).</p>

          <p>The subgroup Miscellaneous Records (primarily of the 19th or early 20th century) is an artificially constructed subgroup of miscellaneous documents that have come into the possession of the Bentley Library over the course of a number of years and through a wide variety of sources. All of the documents relate to the Medical School, and many were actually created by the school itself, but were separated from the school's papers. The documents are arranged alphabetically under three categories: Primarily of the 19th or Early 20th Century; Miscellaneous Reports, 1971 and 1979-1982; and School flag / Victor Vaughan Memorial.</p>

                <p>The Gibson Studio of Ann Arbor took a series photos of Medical School classrooms, laboratories, and student and faculty groups in 1983. There are some additional Gibson images which may have been taken at a different time. Access to the high-quality albumen prints is restricted for preservation reasons. Photocopies are available for reference use in the reading room. All of the identifiable Gibson photos have been scanned and are available through the Bentley Library's Image Bank. Links below provide access to the scanned images.</p>
