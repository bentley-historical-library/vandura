    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Hanes Walton, Jr. was born September 25, 1941, in an African American family in Augusta, Georgia. He attended public school in Athens, graduating with honors in 1959. Walton pursued his undergraduate education at Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he was honored as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society before graduating in 1963, and received a Master of Arts degree from Atlanta University in 1964. In 1967, he became the first person to graduate with a Ph.D. in government from Howard University in the District of Columbia. All of Walton's alma maters were historically black academic institutions, and Walton advocated for these and similar colleges for the remainder of his life. </p>
      <p>Walton enjoyed a long and prestigious career as a respected professor of political science. Following his graduation from Howard, he taught for four years at Savannah State College (subsequently renamed Savannah State University) before serving a one-year term at his alma mater Atlanta University (later called Clark Atlanta University). Walton returned to Savannah State in 1972 and served as a Congressional Fellow at the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1984. Upon his return to his home state, Walton assumed an additional position as adjunct professor at the University of Georgia in 1984. In 1992, he became part of the faculty of the University of Michigan as a professor of American politics. A joint appointment as a research professor for the Center for Political Research at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research followed. Walton was also active in professional organizations, serving as vice president of the American Political Science Association and cofounding the National Conference of Black Political Scientists.</p>
      <p>Over the course of his nearly fifty years as a professor, Walton proved a prolific writer and a vigorous scholar, especially in the areas of African American politics, presidential elections, and public policy. In 1972, he published the work that became the foundation of his career, a book entitled <title render="italic">Black Politics: A Theoretical and Structural Analysis</title>. In the years that followed, Walton penned an additional twenty-four books--including seminal textbooks--twenty-six book chapters, eighty-three articles, and fifty-five book reviews; he also gave more than two dozen presentations at professional conferences and contributed several sections to encyclopedias. He played an active role as a reader and editorial board member of numerous professional journals, critiquing and selecting work by some of the nation's top scholars. Throughout all of facets of his career as an academician, Walton exhibited incisive insight and blazed trails that codified black American political science as a field, leading many colleagues to endow him with the unofficial honorific "Dean of Black Politics."</p>
      <p>Although Walton's scholarly research left a remarkable legacy, it was his gifted teaching that his students most vividly remembered. In the classroom, Walton peppered his lectures with gripping anecdotes and witty jokes about American politicians and current events. While at Savannah State, Walton was named to by the Callaway Foundation to the Fuller E. Callaway Professorial Chair, a position reserved for professors whose teaching abilities achieved a distinguished level of engagement. Moreover, his dedication to connecting with students at a personal level on the topics at hand prompted many undergraduates in his courses to pursue degrees in political science and to become professors themselves. </p>
      <p>Hanes Walton died at his home in Ann Arbor on January 7, 2013, at the age of seventy-two. The University of Michigan group Political Scientists of Color continues to honor Walton's legacy by annually hosting the Dr. Hanes Walton Jr. Distinguished Speaker Lecture.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <p>The collection is organized into four series on the basis of subject and purpose of the constituent materials: Research and Writing, Teaching and Advising, Professional Organizations and Advocacy, and Memorials. The materials within each series are arranged chronologically.</p>
    </arrangement>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>Materials in the Hanes Walton papers will be of particular interest to those seeking to understand one of the nation's preeminent African American political scientists as academician, teacher, and advocate; the collection's contents also illuminate broader questions of minority education, political participation by African Americans, and the process of scholarly publication in the United States. Although Walton enjoyed a career of more than forty years at four collegiate institutions, the coverage provided by his collection begins in the late 1980s and addresses his time at Savannah State College and the University of Michigan. Materials include drafts of works and reviews, research material, and correspondence. Also, video recordings of tributes to Walton by his University of Michigan colleagues, as well as of the 2015 memorial lecture in his name. </p>

          <p>Materials in the Teaching and Advising series (1991-2012; 2.4 linear feet) pertain to Walton as a professor and mentor of students. Walton took sincere interest in the growth of students' careers and minds, whether graduate or undergraduate, and was a particular advocate for young African American political scientists. Items in the series reflect this passion and include drafts of doctoral dissertations and undergraduate honors theses, selected letters of recommendation for students, and a limited amount of correspondence with his protégés. Also included in the Teaching and Advising series are materials pertaining to operation of the Department of Political Science, collaborative proposals for training courses in the field, and syllabi from Walton's courses, among other documents.</p>

          <p>The Professional Organizations and Advocacy series (1992-2005; 1 linear foot) addresses Walton's interests with regard to the broader field of political science and education. A graduate of three historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Walton was an avid proponent of these institutions and lent his voice to matters of their operation and administration as an alumnus and former professor. In addition to correspondence and research studies pertaining to HBCUs, this series includes materials pertaining to Walton's role as a leader of political science societies, such as files on book awards presented by the National Conference of Black Political Scientists and the American Political Science Association.</p>
