      <p>Allan G. Feldt was born in Tonawanda, New York in 1932. He received his B.S. in Physics (1954), M.A. in Sociology (1958), and Ph.D. in Sociology (1963) from the University of Michigan. Feldt held a faculty position at Cornell University from 1962-1971, as well as several visiting professorships at other universities. He began teaching at the University of Michigan in 1971. At the university he served as Professor of Urban and Regional Planning in the College of Architecture and Design (College of Architecture and Urban Planning between 1974 and 1999; since 1999, A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture + Urban Planning). In 1983, Feldt was awarded the Sol King Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 1989, he was awarded the Award of Professional Distinction by the Urban Planning Alumni Society for leadership and achievements in the planning profession. Feldt developed a number of simulation games, including the Community Land Use Game (CLUG), the Northern Virginia Decision Simulation (NOVADS), and the Water and Land Resource Utilization Simulation (WALRUS). His games served as influences for current urban planning simulation games. He served as a consultant for other simulation game projects. Feldt retired from teaching in 1994. </p>

      <p>The Allan G. Feldt papers, 1962-2013, consist of materials related to his work creating simulation games for urban and regional planning. The collection includes manuals, correspondence, planning, and press materials related to the development of the Community Land Use Game (CLUG), the Northern Virginia Decision Simulation (NOVADS), Water and Land Resource Utilization Simulation (WALRUS), and the Population Policies Orientation Model (PPOM).</p>
      <p>The CLUG is a teaching tool designed around a team activity focused on the challenges of business strategy, city management, and community building that was developed in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>The NOVADS is a simulation game that begins with a major economic, political, social, and environmental properties of Fairfax County, Virginia as they existed in 1970. Each team represents a local household responsible for decision making according to specific economic, social, political, and geographic interests.</p>
      <p>The WALRUS is an adaption of CLUG and was developed and published by the Michigan Sea Grant Program in 1972. The game deals with water pollution and sewage issues in a small city surrounded by farm land at the base of a large bay or lake. </p>
      <p>The PPOM was developed in 1971 to address the questions of policy affecting and concerning human populations that are spatially distributed within finite geographical boundaries. Players are asked to be decision makers at a local, state, and national level and learn how to decisions affect the game's population.</p>
