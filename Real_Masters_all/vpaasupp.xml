      <p>As of 1995 the office represented by this record group is officially titled the Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. Previous titles of the office were: Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs and Provost, 1983-1995; Vice President for Academic Affairs, 1962-1983; and Provost, 1938-1962.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Provost</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The origins of this office date back to 1938, during President Ruthven's administration, when the position of provost was created by a bylaw of the Board of Regents to "aid the President by performing such of the President's functions as shall from time to time be delegated by him or by the Board of Regents" (Regents' Proceedings, March 1938, p. 505). E. Blythe Stason, the dean of the Law School who had already been performing many of these functions, was appointed the first provost. Stason resigned as provost in November 1944 to devote his attentions to the leadership of the Law School, and James P. Adams, vice president of Brown University and former University of Michigan economics professor, assumed the post of provost and professor of economics in January 1945. At the Regents' meeting of January 1945 the bylaw establishing the provost's position was amended to include the statement that the provost "shall be the chief executive officer of the University next to the President" (Regents' Bylaw 2.02). Adams remained the provost until his resignation in July 1,951. A successor to Adams was not named, and the responsibilities of the provost were absorbed by the newly created vice president and dean of faculties, Marvin Niehuss.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Vice President for Academic Affairs</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1962 two new positions were created in the university administration: executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs.</p>
      <p>Marvin Niehuss, vice president for university relations since 1945 and the vice president and dean of faculties since 1951, was promoted to the position of executive vice president in 1962. As vice president and dean of faculties, Niehuss had coordinated university relations with the state legislature and had overseen the administration of the schools, colleges, and other units (including institutes, Extension Service, summer session, and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps), reporting on enrollment, teaching loads, research, and faculty salaries. In his new position as executive vice president, Niehuss continued to supervise legislative relations and served as the University's contact with the state board of education. In addition, the executive vice president was the chief executive assistant to the president and assumed the duties and powers of the president in his absence. (When Niehuss retired in 1968 the position of executive vice president was abolished and a vice president for state relations and planning was established in its place.)</p>
      <p>Roger Heyns, a member of the Psychology Department and since 1959 dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, was appointed to the position of vice president for academic affairs in 1962. Heyns assumed many of the duties previously performed by the vice president and dean of faculties. He was given general executive responsibility for the faculty and for the academic programs of the schools, colleges, and other educational units. He reviewed recommendations of deans, directors, and department heads with regard to appointments, promotions, leaves of absence, and salaries of faculty members and special service personnel. In addition, the Offices of Admissions, and Registration and Records--previously under the jurisdiction of the vice president for student affairs--were brought under the vice president for academic affairs.</p>
      <p>This reorganization of administrative responsibilities was intended as a means of unifying planning in a period of rapid growth of the University. In actual practice, the duties associated with planning remained dispersed and were shifted from one office to another in the 1960s and 1970s. When a vice presidency for state relations and planning was established in 1968, some of the responsibility for academic program planning was transferred to that office. The Office of Institutional Research, which collected and analyzed data on enrollment trends, faculty characteristics, funding, and related subjects, was transferred in 1969 from Academic Affairs to State Relations and Planning. In 1974 the Office of Institutional Research was renamed the Office of Academic Planning and Analysis and was returned to Academic Affairs, reflecting the assignment of additional evaluation and planning responsibilities under the vice president for academic affairs. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the vice president for academic affairs gradually assumed greater responsibility for budget preparation.</p>
      <p>In addition to program and budget planning, the Office of Academic Affairs was involved in implementing affirmative action plans, overseeing the Opportunity Program and Tuskegee-Michigan exchange program, and coordinating support services for minority students.</p>
      <p>When Roger Heyns left the university in 1965 to become chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, he was succeeded by Allan F. Smith, the dean of the Law School. Smith held the post of vice president for academic affairs for nine years and in 1974 was followed by Frank H. T. Rhodes, a professor of geology and since 1971 dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Rhodes resigned in 1977 to assume the presidency of Cornell University.</p>
      <p>Harold T. Shapiro, chairman of the Economics Department, was appointed vice president for academic affairs in 1977 and held the position until 1980, when he became president of the University of Michigan. Alfred Sussman, dean of Rackham School of Graduate Studies, served as acting vice president for academic affairs from November 1, 1979 through July 1, 1980, when Billy E. Frye, professor of Zoology and dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, assumed the position.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost</emph>
      </p>
      <p>At its February 1983 meeting, the Regents of the University of Michigan changed the title of the position to Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost (hereafter referred to as "provost"). The move to include "provost" in the title was taken in part because of the increased responsibility of the vice president within the university's administration and because of the need to assist the president as he moved into state and national projects, notably the management of the capital campaign fund-raising effort.</p>
      <p>In 1986, Billy E. Frye resigned and was replaced by James J. Duderstadt, dean of the College of Engineering, who served as provost until he became the president of the university in September 1988. Robert Holbrook served as interim provost until December 1988. In January 1989, Charles Vest, dean of the College of Engineering, became provost and remained until July 1,990, when he left to assume the presidency of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Holbrook served as interim provost for the month of August, after which Gilbert Whitaker, dean of the School of Business Administration, began his tenure as provost.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In September 1993 the Regents approved a change in title to provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. This title was intended to reflect more accurately the responsibilities of the provost and to "bring Michigan into line with the administrative structures of other universities" (The University Record 49(3), 1993 September 20: 4). The new designation came about when President Duderstadt recommended a change in title for Whitaker. In 1995 Whitaker returned to teaching and was succeeded by J. Bernard Machen, dean of the School of Dentistry. Machen initially served on an interim basis before agreeing to accept a two-year appointment. He did not seek an extension and was succeeded by Nancy Cantor, dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies in 1997.</p>
      <p>The position vice provost for academic affairs was created in 1990 to recognize university-wide activities in which John H. D'Arms, dean of Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, was engaged that were beyond the scope of his decanal responsibilities. Such responsibilities included overseeing the Bentley Historical Library and the Clements Library, evaluating promotion and tenure dossiers, and serving as liaison between the university and major foundations (The University Record 45(24), 1990 March 26: 1). With the appointment of new provosts the functional responsibilities and reporting relationships of the vice provost have frequently changed.</p>

      <p>The Supplemental Files subgroup of the record group Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs consists of 153 linear feet (in 157 boxes) and spans the years from 1953 to 2013. This subgroup consists of material that was not interfiled with the vice presidents' or staff's papers when the record group was received. The records generally were not created or maintained by any one staff member in the Office of Academic Affairs, but rather are the result of the examination of a particular issue or topic over a period of time by a variety of people.</p>
      <p>There are twelve series of varying sizes which comprise this subgroup. For an alphabetical list of the series in this subgroup, please consult the Summary Contents List in the Arrangement section of the finding aid.</p>

              <p>The Opportunity Program subseries, 1967-1980 (1 linear foot), consists mainly of papers of George D. Goodman, who became director of the program in 1973/74 and had been on the staff prior to that time. The Opportunity Program was created in 1963/64 to provide scholarships and support services for disadvantaged, primarily minority, students. Goodman's papers, which are arranged alphabetically by subject, include information on minority recruitment, enrollment, and support services, as well as minutes of Opportunity Program staff meetings. There is also a small quantity of papers of William L. Cash, Jr., who as assistant to the president for human relations affairs coordinated the program in 1971/1972. Researchers should also see subseries on the Opportunity Program in the files of Richard English and John Romani in the Staff Files subgroup.</p>

              <p>The Thurnau Trust and Thurnau Professorships subseries, 1979-2001, (1 linear foot) includes the records of the administration of the bequest of Arthur F. Thurnau. Thurnau was student at the University between 1902 and 1904, and made the University the beneficiary of a bequest of approximately $3,000,000. The provost, Billy Frye, requested the faculty to submit proposals suggesting how the money should be employed, and in particular solicited ideas for research of intellectual significance and future promise. Several faculty members independently submitted proposals within the molecular genetics field, and Frye encouraged them to confer together and submit a joint, interdisciplinary proposal, which was funded through the proceeds of the trust. In 1988, the then provost, Jim Duderstadt, asked the Regents to repurpose the income from the Thurnau bequest to recognize and reward faculty for outstanding contributions to undergraduate education. The program honored tenured faculty whose commitment and investment in undergraduate teaching had a demonstrable impact on the intellectual development of Michigan students.</p>

              <p>The Career Development Fund for Women Faculty subseries, 1994-1999 (2.7 linear feet), illustrates the efforts of the provost to ease the administrative burden placed on women faculty members. Because of their small numbers, women often carried a disproportionate commitment for student advising, department, college and University committees, dissertation committees, and other service activities. This program awarded $5,000 each to female tenured and tenure-track faculty members who demonstrated professional achievement and significant service (other than classroom teaching). The award was to be used to support graduate students, travel or research materials. The records typically contain the applicant's vita, a statement about her service commitments, and an evaluator's form. It is a very good source for an interdisciplinary sampling of women faculty CV's for this period.</p>

              <p>The Presidents' Council of the State Universities of Michigan (PCSUM) subseries, 1994-2004 (15 linear feet), serves as a forum for the presidents and chancellors of Michigan's fifteen public universities to discuss and frame positions on key higher education finance and policy issues. Its predecessor, the Michigan Council of State College Presidents was formed in 1952. Representatives from the Provost's Office attended meetings with other universities' representatives to evaluate and approve new academic programs. This series consists largely of the records of these program reviews, proposed by all of Michigan's universities, in numerical order. There are additional records of the PCSUM in the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs-Staff record group, as follows:</p>

              <p>The Office Policy and Office Holder Documents subseries, 1982-2013 (10.4 linear feet), is comprised of reports and policies describing the operation and functions of the Provost's office and some biographical information on former vice presidents and provosts. Two volumes prepared in 1990 for the incoming office holder describe in detail the inner workings of the office and offer some historic insight into policy positions. Also included here are files on some of the vice presidents and provosts beginning with Billy E. Frye. Material includes copies of curricula vitae, clippings, and speeches and presentations made by Frye, Charles M. Vest, Gilbert Whitaker, Bernard Machen, Nancy Cantor, Edward Gramlich, Philip Hanlon, Paul Courant, and Teresa Sullivan.</p>

              <p>The Task Force on Campus Safety and Security (TFCSS) subseries, 1992-1997 (1 linear foot), was appointed by the Provost on July 9, 1996, to review progress toward achieving the recommendations of the 1989 Task Force on Campus Safety and Security and to assess safety needs and perceptions on campus. The task force, chaired by Paul Boylan, began its work in the Fall of 1996 and submitted its report in April 1997. The task force was organized into five groups. Group I reviewed crime statistics at peer institutions and compared peer policies and operation with those at Michigan. Group II studied enhancements since 1990 including campus lighting and escort programs. Group III organized campus meetings with various constituencies to gauge community perceptions of safety and security. Group IV identified all campus agencies involved in conflict resolution with an emphasis on harassment. Group V focused on the Department of Public Safety, including policies, procedures, personnel, and budget. Documentation includes the charge to the task force, background material studied by the working groups, meeting minutes, as well as the final report. The final report contains extensive appendices, including a study by the Institute for Social Research (ISR) on "Perceptions of Safety and Security at the University of Michigan."</p>
