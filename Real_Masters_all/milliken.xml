      <p>William Grawn Milliken was governor of Michigan from 1969-1982, the longest term in state history. A Yale-educated businessman and politician, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1964 and 1966, after serving four years in the State Senate, the last two as majority floor leader. He assumed the governorship on January 22, 1969, when George Romney resigned to become secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in Richard Nixon's cabinet. Michigan voters returned Milliken to office in the 1970, 1974, and 1978 elections. His first gubernatorial victory was narrow, with just a 44,000 vote margin. But citizen favor for him grew, and by 1978, his last test at the polls, Milliken won by nearly 400,000 votes. Many of his supporters were ticket-splitters or former Democrats.</p>
      <p>Although chief executive during the deepest economic crisis experienced in Michigan since the Depression, Governor Milliken was generally popular among both the people of the state and his political peers. A well-regarded politician, he chaired the National Governor's Association during 1977-1978 and the Midwest Governor's Association in 1974. He was the principal leader of the state GOP and a national force in the moderate wing of the Republican Party. Conservative elements within the party were often critical of the bipartisan, alliance-building style that led him to court labor, occasionally appoint Democrats to state jobs, and supported pro-choice legislation on abortion.</p>
      <p>Milliken led the state during a conflict-ridden era that frequently tested his ability as a crisis manager--for example, the General Motors strike of 1970, two Arab oil embargoes, contamination of the food chain with the toxic chemical PBB, and a controversy surrounding the state mental health system. He was admired for a firmness of conviction on issues that mattered greatly to him, such as the responsibility of government to cities, the arts, the environment, and the poor. The state revenue sharing program that helped Detroit during troubled economic times was adopted largely through Milliken's efforts. His administration was noted for its commitment to conservation and the passage of the Environmental Protection Act of 1970, which serve a model legislation throughout the nation; the budget stabilization fund and efforts at economic development; and, in the last days of his term, worker and unemployment compensation reforms and enactment of a transportation package. Milliken announced his decision not to seek reelection on December 22, 1981. After retiring from public office, he joined Chrysler Corporation's board of directors and chaired the Center for the Great Lakes, a private economic and environmental research center devoted to protecting regional lake resources.</p>
      <p>William Milliken was born in Traverse City on March 26, 1922, to James Thacker Milliken and Hildegarde Grawn. A waist-gunner on a World War II B-24 bomber, he received military honors, including the Purple Heart, for participation in 50 combat missions. From 1947-1955, he served on the Michigan Waterways Commission. The U.S. State Department selected him in 1953 to spend 75 days in West Germany in an intercultural exchange program and in 1971 to tour the Soviet Union and Romania. Governor Milliken is a past president of J.W. Milliken, Inc., a Michigan department store chain headquartered in Traverse City, with outlets in Manistee and Cadillac. His wife is the former Helen Wallbank of Denver, Colorado; they have two children, William, Jr. and Elaine.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <p>The Milliken papers are organized in six subgroups: Correspondence, Administrative/Executive, Regional Offices, Political, Miscellaneous, and Audio-Visual Material. The Correspondence subgroup contains routine constituent incoming and outgoing mail and scattered policy-related materials. Items are indexed by correspondent in the master suspense card file. The Administrative/Executive subgroup includes the collection's core policy documents. Regional Offices consists of policy and operational materials on the governors official outposts. The Political subgroup contains sequences on the governor's appointments to office, fundraising and campaigns for the governorship, participation in presidential elections, and participation in the state and national Republican party. Miscellaneous subgroup contains papers created while Milliken served as Lieutenant Governor; audits, conference proceedings, task force recommendations, and general reports. Audio-Visual Materials includes the collection’s scant holdings of artifacts, photographs, scrapbooks, and sound recordings.</p>
      <p>Some peculiarities characterize the files. Users should note that correspondence appears as both a subgroup and type of document found in all principal series. Folder headings are titled inconsistently throughout the inventory. Files on the same topic may appear in one series under a subject title, in another by geographic location, and in a third by the name of participant. To insure a thorough search, scan the contents list for all conceivable headings.</p>

      <p>The William G. Milliken Papers is the most important source available for the study of Michigan's state government from 1969-1982. The collection currently measures 1478 linear feet and includes correspondence, memoranda, reports, agenda and minutes, briefing books, press releases and public statements, legal briefs and decisions, legislative bills and bill analyses, clippings, and printed works that pertain to Milliken's years as governor. Half of the papers arrived at the Bentley Historical Library in December 1982, from State Record Center retirement. Another portion came directly from the Capitol Complex at the end of Milliken's term. Several hundred feet arrived in 1983 from the governor's Traverse City office. Smaller accessions related to politics and political appointments were received in the late 1980s.</p>
      <p>Materials in the collection concern the official conduct of state government including the governor's role in legislative activity; the interface of state-federal jurisdictions; and the administration of the executive office, departments, commissions, and regional offices. The papers provide a rich resource for the study of executive response to concerns such as economic development, hazardous wastes, civil rights and affirmative action, labor, energy, minority populations, education, urban development, sex discrimination, and regional issues. As the governor remained active in the Republican party and sought election three times, the collection also includes materials on political matters. Files created by Milliken while Lieutenant Governor appear as well.</p>

          <p>The Milliken Correspondence is organized into several series and subseries. The largest is a Chronological file with subdivisions in each year for General Subjects, Departments and Commissions, Federal and Legislative Smaller series include Study Commissions, Special Letters, Petitions/Citizen's Mail, Governor's Personal Correspondence and mechanically generated Robo Mail. All of the Chronological Correspondence Files (1969-1982, Boxes 1-554, 558-572, 1538), the Study Commissions Correspondence (Boxes 558-572) and the ROBO letters (Boxes 1619-1771) have been transferred to the State of Michigan Archives.</p>

            <p>General Subjects is a chronological subject file arranged alphabetically by correspondent's last name that consists entirely of topical incoming citizen letters and petitions. Attached to each inquiry is the governor's or staff member's response. Access material by name (see card index system) or subject (refer to master list of headings).</p>
            <p>The Departments and Commissions correspondence is a chronological run of records arranged by year and thereunder alphabetically by department or commission. Some headings are directly followed by files titled Director or Material. These folders contain resource material that may include correspondence, memos, budgets, annual reports, audits, minutes, press releases, reports, and printed matter. Items of this type appear most often for the earlier years and are only a fraction of the files. The bulk of the files consists of citizen complaints relevant to particular government offices.</p>
            <p>Filing idiosyncrasies exist. In 1973 the Department of Administration became the Department of Management and Budget. It assumed responsibility for the Bureau of programs and Budget (detailed in Michigan Manual, 1973-1974, pp. 281-286). Beginning in 1976, a new folder title, Volunteers in Michigan, appears. The physical placement of this file suggests independent commission status, but it is actually a subdepartment of the Department of Management and Budget. Beginning in 1980 the Department of Highways appears as Transportation and Police as State Police.</p>
            <p>Correspondence can be accessed by name (see card index system) or department (see master list below). Policy materials related to this sequence may be found in the Staff Files and Internal Memoranda and Correspondence series.</p>
            <p>Federal Correspondence is comprised principally of constituent correspondence related to federal legislation or regulations. Material is arranged by subject until 1978; beginning in 1979, items are filed alphabetically by the correspondent's name. Policy materials related to this sequence may be found in the Staff Files, Internal Memoranda and Correspondence, Washington Office, and Political series. Correspondence can be accessed by name (see the card index system) or by subject for the years 1969-1978 (see master list below).</p>
            <p>The Legislative correspondence contains constituent mail regarding pending legislation. Material is arranged alphabetically by correspondent's name, with some topical headings for earlier years. Policy materials related to this sequence may be found in most other series. Access by name (see card index system) or subject (see master list below).</p>

            <p>Unfiled Correspondence is a sequence of incoming letters, some with the response attached, never filed in established correspondence series. Material is arranged in three runs: number files, miscellaneous, and general. The number files arrived with Billie Harrison's staff files, 1980-1982. This correspondence often involves complex issues that required staff consensus to compose a response. Material is indexed in the master suspense card file with a number to indicate location. A summary of the files, listing subject and correspondent, is located at the front of the sequence. The miscellaneous run contains routine mail arranged chronologically. The general run contains mail directed to departments and commissions in 1982; this was unfiled at the end of Milliken's term.</p>

            <p>The series State Administrative Board Meetings is a chronological series that records the operations of the State Administrative Board, which is composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, state treasurer, and superintendent of public instruction. The board has authority to exercise general supervisory control over the functions and activities of all administrative departments, boards, commissions, and offices of the state and all state institutions. It also assumes many specific statutory responsibilities, including approval of contracts and leases, allotment of annual appropriations, investment of funds, travel regulations, and settlement of small claims against the state. Files contain meeting agendas and minutes, background information on issues before the board, and related materials. No records were received for 1972.</p>

            <p>Internal Memoranda and Correspondence contains the core policy documents of the Milliken administration. Files consist of communications on issues where gubernatorial action was taken or considered and include memoranda, correspondence, telephone summaries, and related papers. The materials are arranged in three sequences: Governor's internal communication to the staff; Staff, including the directors of departments and commissions, internal communications with the governor and other staff; and Subject Files that collate material on a single topic. Principal access is through a particular staff person. Refer to Appendix A (Index to Staff Files) for cursory summaries of each staff person's responsibilities. Should the index fail to provide a point of entry, refer to Research Strategy for Use. Limited topical access is available through subject files. The Governor's sequence allows entry by year for the period 1968-1982, but the material for 1972 and 1974 is fragmentary.</p>

            <p>The Staff Files series consists of policy and operational papers created by many executive office staff. Materials include memoranda, correspondence, reports, agenda and minutes, legal briefs and decisions, press releases, clippings, and printed works. Files also contain items referred to as briefing, or issues, books. These chronological notebooks serve as the governor's briefing tool for establishing executive policy by compiling reports, correspondence, and memos that analyze priorities, provide background information, and recommend legislative/executive action.</p>
            <p>Files are arranged by staff person rather than by office or subject and, therefore, do not readily accommodate research of a single topic. A subject approach to the series is further impeded by its size, 224 linear feet. Yet this series contains the bulk of the collection's topical materials. For example, Staff Files include rich source materials on economic growth and development, education, transportation, human services, women's rights, labor, minorities, urban affairs, PBB and toxic wastes, nuclear energy, and similar matters. Several techniques may prove helpful when doing research: Use Appendix A (Index to Staff Files) and Appendix B (Staff Listing); these general lists may provide some direction for searching. Search the Ellsworth/Frankland sequence first (see Research Strategy for Use). Refer to the subject files of Internal Memoranda and Correspondence. If your topic appears, note the staff member responsible, then search their files.</p>
            <p>Several filing traits are distinctive to this series. Topical files, as commonly understood, include many formats of material, but are not characterized by singular runs of correspondence or memoranda. Within the Staff Files, subseries of correspondence or memoranda often have been placed within topical sequences, filed under 'C' or 'M' respectively. The staff materials, as a whole, were created between 1965 and 1982. Each subseries of staff member's papers have been individually dated within this time frame, but these dates are only approximate.</p>
            <p>Of special note are the files of Isabella Saxton, head of Milliken's Communications Unit. These files include studies and recommendations on the reorganization of work in the offices responsible for citizen mail, summary mail counts, content analysis of letters received, and memoranda. Saxton's files also include ROBO responses to constituent correspondence; these machine-generated outgoing letters delineate the administration's positions on issues of the day.</p>
            <p>The Early Program Material files, 1968-1973, are of import in that they document the early years of Milliken's tenure, before administrative reorganization. They include materials on human services and educational issues, records of the Executive Office, Programs and Policies, budgets, files on health, crime, economic opportunity, law enforcement and criminal justice, planning and youth, and state financing of local education.</p>

            <p>A series of records, 1968-1982, created by Milliken's advance scheduler (Richard Schlaff and predecessors) for the purpose of briefing the governor on daily commitments. Files include routine scheduling materials and policy papers with background information. Materials are arranged in two main sequences: Daily Commitments and Topical Files.</p>
            <p>The master suspense card file may index some correspondence in this series to Richard Schlaff. Related papers may be found in Staff Files, Regional Offices, Internal Memoranda and Correspondence, and Politics.</p>

              <p>The Daily Commitments subseries includes two groups of papers: Scheduling and Speaking Commitments/Appointments. Scheduling files contain memoranda that request appearances by the governor and general summary materials. Speaking Commitments/Appointments consists of a chronological daily log of the governor's activities with folders that include scheduling papers and policy items used to brief the governor for meetings, speeches, press conferences, and receptions. For assistance in identifying specific dates, see Appendix C, a daily index to Milliken's schedule for 1968-1977, and Press Office general subject files to date the governor's appearances for 1978-1982.</p>

              <p>The Topical Files subseries consists of subject-compiled briefing tools developed by the staff to provide guidance for executive action and may include background information and policy papers. Notable are the briefing books, budget hearings materials, 1972-1983, city/count files that include regional summary data, conference briefings, and briefings on the economy, unemployment, and the Upper Peninsula. The foreign travel files also provide noteworthy insights into Milliken's trips to Japan, the Dominican Republic, Western Europe, and China.</p>

              <p>The Topical Files subseries includes correspondence, memoranda, bills and analyses, and miscellaneous legislative materials. Noteworthy sequences include: action checklists, budgets, correspondence and memoranda, legislative priorities, and the single business tax. The action checklists, 1979-1982, are staff recommendations to the governor on pending legislation. Sheets annotated with the governor's comments include a summary of the issue, recommended action, and analysis of the bill's implications. The budgets, 1977-1982, contain materials on legislative appropriations, including the governor's communications with staff, memos recommending action, conflicts between departments, and strategies for resolving disputes. The correspondence and memoranda document the governor's position on bills, especially as they relate to his State of the State. The legislative priorities records consist of notebooks of memos from department heads, routed to the governor months before the legislative session, these served as discussion tools. The single business tax records, 1973-1977, detail efforts to amend the single business tax legislation; they include memoranda, correspondence, questionnaires and reports, hearings transcripts, surveys, clippings, and legislative recommendations. Sound recordings of the hearings held throughout the state have been filed in boxes 1772-1773. Materials related to legislation can be found throughout the core research series.</p>

            <p>The Press Office series includes the governor's press releases, public statements, speeches, and special messages. Files principally consist of press releases arranged in two sequences: a chronological master set and a topical run replete with background information. Additional materials include a run of the "Ask the Governor" columns, press conference transcripts, Milliken's special messages to the legislature and the public, and speeches (including State of the State addresses, 1970-1982).</p>

            <p>A series of policy and administrative records concerning the operations of the governor's Detroit office. Papers grouped in two broad categories, 1969-1975 and 1976-1982, include correspondence, memoranda, reports, agenda and minutes, legal briefs and decisions, press releases, clippings, and printed works. Files document relationship between state government and urban redevelopment on organizational and citizen levels. The papers contain, for example, both the institutional records of the Civil rights Commission (1969-1975), which include major complaints and decisions argued in the state during this period, and records of the Ombudsman, a case file documenting state assistance to individuals resulting from citizen complaints. Many of the Detroit office staff sat on the boards of transitory grassroots and self-help organizations created during the 1970s. As a result, the papers are rich source materials for the study of anonymous or indigent populations and their community organization activities. Researchers interested in the regional workings of the state government or metropolitan concerns--including youth, drug abuse, mental health, refugees, aging, minorities, migrants, school integration and busing, local government, prison reform and corrections, equal opportunity and civil rights, women's rights, and social services--may find useful materials in this series. Related materials may be found in the Staff Files and Internal Memoranda and Correspondence series.</p>

            <p>The Upper Peninsula, a geographically and culturally removed and distinct region, was afforded an executive outpost by the Milliken administration beginning in 1974. Record of the Upper Peninsula office document policy and operations and provide material on a declining region's efforts to cope with economic and social issues. The series includes chronologically arranged working papers of successive staff members: Bruce Lindstrom, 1974-1977; Mary Soper, 1978-1981; and Bob Skuggen, 1981-1982. Lindstrom's papers include only correspondence; the remainder of his files were subsumed by Soper. The Soper sequence contains two groupings: city and county files covering regional issues and topical files on the area's education, energy, native Americans, industry, military affairs, mining, transportation, travel and recreation, and women's rights. Skuggen's papers comprise four sequences: administrative office files, correspondence, memoranda, and topical files.</p>

            <p>A series of policy and operational records maintained by staff member Beth Weems, the governor's Washington office liaison.

The series contains three sequences: Correspondence, Department of Commerce, and Topical Files. The first sequence is a chronological run of correspondence from 1973-1982. The last two sequences are arranged alphabetically by subject. Related papers may be found in Staff Files and Internal Memoranda and Correspondence series.</p>

            <p>A series of records pertaining to Milliken's political appointments. The bulk of the materials comprise three sequences: Boards, Commissions, Task Forces, etc.; Judicial; and Persons Appointed. The first contains chiefly topical files arranged by key-word and includes police investigative reports, summaries of candidates political activities, letters of support, and announcements of appointments. Appendix D lists most folder headings that appear. The summary information and master index are too fragmentary to be reliably used. The Judicial sequence concerns the governor's appointment of judges to courts. Materials generally parallel those found in the 'Boards' sequence, but letters of support appear more frequently. The Persons Appointed files are arranged alphabetically by the appointee's name.</p>
            <p>Several smaller file runs cover appointments to college and university boards, county jury boards, social services boards and study commissions. The remaining papers, the office files of Joyce Braithwaite, supplement the core sequences but are less notable and extensive. These include registers of all appointments. Related materials may be found in Staff Files and perhaps Internal Memoranda and Correspondence.</p>

            <p>The campaigns series contains general campaign files, 1970-1982, from staff who served as the governor's closest political advisors, and other miscellaneous papers. The files are an especially rich source on the financing, planning, and analysis of gubernatorial politicking. The campaign of 1978 is best documented. Related materials may be found in Staff Files and the Governor's Personal: 1970 correspondence for additional coverage of Milliken's first campaign.</p>

            <p>The series Republican Party, 1969-1982, includes records that document Milliken's relationship to the Republican Party at various levels. The materials of this series are arranged in three sequences: Fundraisers, Michigan, and National Campaigns. The Fundraisers sequence consists of materials related to Milliken's primary fundraising activity, Bill's Beefsteak Dinners, from 1973 to 1982. The Michigan sequence consists of conference agenda, minutes, and reports; correspondence with party members, county officials, and legislators; and a topical file. The last sequence, National (Presidential) Campaigns consists of correspondence, memoranda, reports, and position papers related to the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan campaigns. Of these, the 1980 campaign is best documented.</p>

            <p>The Reports series unites audits, conference proceedings, task force recommendations, and general reports. This series includes four sequences: office of the auditor general, topical, special reports of the governor, and departments' annual reports. The auditor general's audits, annual reports, and correspondence makes up the smallest of these sequences. The extensive topical sequence consists of government reports or independent studies arranged alphabetically by keyword in title or corporate entry. The special reports of the governor consists of messages, plans, or guidelines issued by Milliken. The departments and commissions annual reports sequence offers scattered coverage of select offices.</p>
