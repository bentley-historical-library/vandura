      <p>The University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) houses the second largest art collection in the state of Michigan, offering a rich permanent collection supplemented by an active special exhibition program. In addition, the many and varying art collections assist in teaching at the university. The collections of Chinese and Japanese paintings and ceramics; Old Master and contemporary prints and drawings; and Whistler prints are particularly strong.</p>
      <p>The museum was established in its present form in 1946. The University Regents declared in November 1945 that the Museum of Art and Archaeology be abolished and that two separate units (the Museum of Art and the Museum of Archaeology) take its place. At their January 1946 meeting, the Regents further stipulated that the Museum of Art be maintained as "a separate administrative unit for the purpose of collection, conservation, study and exhibition of works of art and the preparation of publications with respect thereunto." The university's art collections had their origins long before 1946, however. Early systematic collecting began in 1855 when Professor Henry S. Frieze purchased a number of art works, chiefly engravings and plaster casts, to illustrate his courses in classical art and archaeology. In 1862 Frieze was instrumental in acquiring the university's first significant original work of art, Randolph Rogers' <title render="italic">Nydia, the Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii.</title></p>
      <p>The collection grew sporadically in the following decades, in large part through gifts from individuals as well as from graduating classes. The Henry C. Lewis bequest came to the university in 1895 and contained more than four hundred paintings and other works of art. With a modest budget for acquisitions, the museum's first director, Jean Paul Slusser, maintained a focus on collecting modern painting, sculpture and graphics and was quite successful due to his aesthetic expertise, knowledge of the New York art market and connections with Ann Arbor art organizations. The collection was further supplemented by gifts, including the Carl F. Clarke bequest of French and American landscape paintings and the Margaret Watson Parker bequest in 1936 (transferred to the museum in 1954 and 1955) of more than 600 Asian and Western works including Japanese prints and paintings by James NcNeill Whistler. Dr. Walter R. Parker (Margaret's husband and professor of ophthalmology at the university) further bequeathed funds to house the collection and to support future acquisitions.</p>
      <p>During the very early years, efforts were made to display the collections. In 1857-1858 they were housed in the North and South Colleges. Space was allocated in the no longer extant library (newly erected in 1883), but even with the additional space gained when the library was enlarged in 1898 the facility could not adequately accommodate the growing collections. In 1910 the collections were moved to Alumni Memorial Hall, sharing the building with the Fine Arts Department and the Alumni Association. The hall has undergone renovations on several occasions. In 1957-1958, a Unistrut system of internal scaffolding was designed by professor of architecture William Muschenheim and installed in the museum apse. This installation increased gallery space. The Unistrut installation was subsequently removed in the early 1970s. Remodeling in 1966-1967 created additional gallery space; modernized the museum's heating, cooling and lighting systems; and provided areas for storage and behind-the-scenes work. The Museum of Art became Alumni Memorial Hall's sole occupant at this time. In 2003, planning was begun for a major expansion designed to increase the building's capacity by 55,000 square feet, to be used for additional gallery space, an auditorium and classrooms, and for a complete renovation of the existing facility.</p>
      <p>Important components of the UMMA's program were added as it continued to expand its exhibitions program. In the late 1950s director Charles Sawyer began presenting museum seminars which, by 1963, had developed into the Museum Practice Program. The program, continued through 1995, provided training for many budding professionals in the museum field and organized numerous successful exhibitions for the UMMA over the years. (The training of museum professionals was revived at the university in Fall 2003 when an interdisciplinary Museum Studies Program was created under the auspices of the Rackham School of Graduate Studies.) The Friends of the Museum of Art was founded in 1968. This group supports the UMMA's acquisitions and other programming. Under director Bret Waller, the Docent Program was established in 1975 to provide tours for school classes and other visitors.</p>

          <p>Exhibition Files (1946-2003; 18 linear ft.) are arranged chronologically by exhibition date. In some cases exhibitions were mounted in locations other than Alumni Memorial Hall. The Rackham Galleries were used on occasion and space in the undergraduate library held travelling exhibitions from 1957/1958 to 1975/1976. Researchers should note that undergraduate library (UGLI) exhibition files are sometimes interfiled with those held in Alumni Memorial Hall (AMH), but other years are filed separately, either before or after AMH exhibits. This listing of exhibitions should not be considered complete. Although it is fairly comprehensive, there are some exhibitions listed on annual schedules for which there is no file and, likewise, there are files for exhibitions which do not appear in annual schedules. When it was clearly identified that an organization other than UMMA organized and/or circulated an exhibition, its name appears in parentheses following the exhibition title and dates.</p>
          <p>Information within individual files varies greatly and may include any or all of the following: correspondence with curators, exhibition organizers, artists and lenders; checklists; gallery floor plans; labels and label copy; pamphlets; publicity material, e.g., newspaper and magazine clippings, press releases; research material and notes; photographs, installation shots and UMMA objects; and audio recordings of artists' lectures and symposia. Material pertaining to the monetary value of museum holdings (at UMMA or elsewhere) or to individual donors (when not otherwise made public) has been removed. When possible, photocopies of the original pages were made with dollar values and names removed. Exhibition catalogues, produced by the UMMA or otherwise, as well as other related printed material (e.g. invitations, brochures, posters) have been filed separately (see separate finding aid for UMMA publications).</p>

          <p>Executive Files (1945-2002; 4.7 linear ft.) are divided into three subseries: Executive Committee Minutes, Director's Correspondence, and Conferences and Committees. Executive Committee Minutes document chiefly loans and acquisitions through purchase and gift, but include other museum business, policies and staff appointments. These files are restricted until July 1, 2024. Director's Correspondence, in keeping with the system maintained by UMMA, is filed according to location of the correspondent, excluding correspondence within the University of Michigan. These are grouped alphabetically by state, then by city, and finally by institution or organization. (Canada and other foreign countries follow the United States.) For example, to locate correspondence with the Walker Art Center, one would consult Minnesota--Minneapolis--Walker Art Center. Within these files, documents are arranged in reverse chronological order. The Conferences and Committees subseries contains a limited amount of material (correspondence and typewritten remarks) related to staff members' professional activities, including professional service and conference participation. These provide insight into museum philosophy at the time on training museum professionals, museum scholarship, and the loaning of works for special exhibitions.</p>

          <p>Photographs (1913-1998; 0.3 linear ft.) document the museum's facilities, both exterior and interior; its staff; and a small number of events throughout its history. Portraits of docents can be found within the Docent series, as well as additional photographs of staff members in the early 1990s. If exhibition installations are identified they are within the Exhibition Files series. Otherwise they are included within this series, under 'Galleries,' which also contains installation shots of the permanent collection galleries. The series includes various media: black and white and color prints, 35mm slides, 35mm negatives and glass plate negatives.</p>
          <p>The 1913 images of the galleries in Alumni Memorial Hall depict the Mum Show held in November of that year where pieces of the university's collection of sculpture were displayed in the building's apse with flowers. The photographs were taken by George R. Swain, university photographer from 1913 to 1947, and are identified in more detail by Swain in an index of his work. The six images are on glass plate negatives (one of which is cracked) but there are prints of two and all but one has been scanned.</p>

          <p>The Publicity series (1986-2001; 2.3 linear ft.) has been artificially arranged into two subseries: Exhibitions and Topical Files. These exhibition files, the earliest of which dates only to 1986, are not nearly as comprehensive as the Exhibition Files series. There is likely some overlap within files since both series contain clippings, but the publicity files have a more extensive collection of these. Also included are object photographs for press releases; educational materials for teacher or parent packets; and correspondence.</p>
          <p>Topical Files are arranged alphabetically and document a variety of the UMMA's programs: Concert Series, Docents, Family Programs, Friends of the Museum of Art and Special Events. These files contain clippings related to particular programs and events; but others can be found under 'Clippings' and 'General' files. Additionally, there is documentation of an evaluation of the mission of the museum as a whole in the early 1990s and a 1991 proposal for a museums complex on campus which was to provide a new facility for both the UMMA and the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology.</p>

          <p>The Museum Practice Program series (1962-2000; 0.5 linear ft.) documents the museum's training program from its inception in the 1960s. It includes information about the curriculum, admission and requirements; lists of participants over the years and their placements in the museum field; and proposals and notes regarding changes to the program during the 1990s. Further discussion of these revisions, which involved launching a more interdisciplinary program not limited to the history of art in 2003, can be found within the correspondence files. Also of interest are course lecture notes written by Charles Sawyer during the program's first decade. A symposium held in 1979 on "American Museums in the Last Quarter of the Twentieth Century" served as a reunion for program graduates and a tribute to Charles Sawyer as well. This file contains correspondence between graduates and Mary Ann "Cricket" Swain, then Associate Chairman of the program; correspondence with Millard Rogers, Director of the Cincinnati Art Museum, who originated the idea for the event; and a thank-you letter from Sawyer to those who participated. The 'Correspondence-Students &amp; staff' file includes reminiscences of Sawyer prompted by the symposium.</p>

          <p>The Historical Background series (1862-1989; 0.2 linear ft.) is largely material gathered by museum staff in preparation for the 1986 exhibition celebrating the UMMA's fortieth anniversary. The majority of these documents are photocopies though there are two manuscripts relating to the museum's history, one written in 1951 and the other in 1970, in the 'General' file. Also part of this series are files on directors and assistant directors which contain curricula vitae and publicity of new appointments and/or resignations.</p>

          <p>The Docents series (1984-2002; 0.3 linear ft.) includes a limited amount of material documenting museum tours and other docent-sponsored events. The 'Recognition/Awards' file contains a pin designed after the UMMA's sculpture <title render="italic">Nydia, The Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii</title> given to docents who had achieved emeritus status from 1993-2000. Also within this series are photographs of members of several docent classes in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
