        <p>The Williams papers were originally arranged and described as six separate collections; Governor's Papers, Non-Gubernatorial Papers, Visual Material, Sound Recordings, Scrapbooks, and State Dept. Microfilm, each of which had its own paper finding aid. Each had a separate box number sequence. In this electronic finding aid each of these collections is treated as a subgroup of the G. Mennen Williams Papers. Boxes in the Governor's Papers subgroup are numbered 1 to 722; the Non-Gubernatorial Papers are 1-N to 105-N; the Visual Materials are 1-P to 21-P; and the Sound Recordings are 1-S to 6-S. Scrapbooks are identified by volume number and the microfilm by reel number. Portions of the Williams Papers were reprocessed in 1996. Some files were reappraised and eliminated from the collection. There was also significant consolidation of boxes with the result that some numbers were eliminated. To facilitate location of items based on citations to the previous physical arrangement, the empty box numbers have been included in the electronic finding aid with the notation "[Eliminated in reprocessing.]"</p>
        <p>Boxes 69, 77, 91, 95, 116, 146, 155, 177, 186, 214, 239, 250, 268, 271, 280, 297, 302, 310, 315, 355-360, 369-371, 681-688, 695-700, and 80-N were eliminated during reprocessing.</p>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>G. Mennen Williams was a man born to privilege but who devoted his life to public service. His career included stints as governor of Michigan from 1949 to 1960, under-secretary of state for African Affairs from 1961 to 1965, and Michigan Supreme Court justice from 1970 to 1986. Williams was born in Detroit, February 23, 1911, to Henry P. and Elma Mennen Williams. After prepping at the Salisbury School in Connecticut, he received his AB degree at Princeton in 1933. Williams finished his formal education by taking a JD degree from the University of Michigan in 1936.</p>
      <p>Williams began his career as an attorney for the Social Security Board in Washington, D. C. In 1938 he returned to Michigan to serve as assistant attorney general under Raymond Starr. His public career took him back to Washington where he acted as executive assistant to United States Attorney General Frank Murphy, from 1939 to 1940. He continued to work for Murphy until 1941 as special assistant in the Criminal Division.</p>
      <p>With American entry into World War II, Williams' public service took a new form. Despite being thirty-one years old and the father of a young son, Williams sought and gained a commission as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He saw active duty as an air combat intelligence officer in the Pacific theater. After his discharge in 1946, Williams served as deputy director of the Office of Price Administration for Michigan until 1947. He then took a position as the Democratic member of the Michigan Liquor Control Commission and used this post to build a network of supporters for his gubernatorial campaign in 1948.</p>
      <p>Williams was elected governor of Michigan on the Democratic ticket in November 1948. The result was something of an upset in that Michigan was a strongly Republican state. Williams continued to upset Michigan Republicans, narrowly winning re-election in 1950, then winning the 1952, 1954, 1956, and 1958 elections. His re-election in 1958 gave him an unprecedented sixth consecutive term.</p>
      <p>By not running for state office in 1960, Williams left himself available to serve the nation as a whole. At one time thought to be under consideration for the vice-presidency, Williams was eventually tapped by President Kennedy to serve as undersecretary of state for African Affairs. Williams held this post until 1966 when he decided to campaign for the U.S. Senate; he lost to Robert Griffin. Williams returned to the public sphere when President Johnson appointed him ambassador to the Philippines in 1967. He held this post until Richard Nixon became president in January 1969.</p>
      <p>Williams resumed his career of public service to the state of Michigan by winning election to the State Supreme Court in 1970. He headed a reform movement within the judiciary to make administration of justice "effective and efficient." He served so capably during his first term that he was easily re-elected in 1978 and was elected Chief Justice by his peers in April 1983. Williams retired from the bench in 1987 and died February 2, 1988. He was survived by his wife, Nancy Quirk Williams, and three children, Gery, Nancy, and Wendy.</p>

      <p>The G. Mennen Williams Collection is composed of six subgroups; Governor's Papers, Non-Gubernatorial papers and Visual Materials, Sound Recordings, Scrapbooks,and State Department Files Microfilm. Each of these sections is comprised of a number of, series and subseries. This electronic finding aid to the Williams papers is structured to reflect the intellectual organization of the papers as opposed to its physical arrangement in boxes. As a result, within any series or subseries the box numbers may not follow in consecutive order.</p>

      <p>The G. Mennen Williams Papers consist of official and personal files arranged into six subgroups: 1) Gubernatorial papers, 1949-1960 (681 linear ft.); 2) Non-gubernatorial papers, 1883-1948 and 1958-1988 (107 linear ft.); 3) Visual materials, ca. 1911-1988 (ca. 25 linear ft.); 4) sound recordings, 1950-ca. 1988 (5 linear ft.) Scrapbooks, 1948-1987 (43 vols.) and State Department Microfilm, 1961-1966 (23 reels).</p>
      <p>As part of its own control system, the governor's office maintained a card index to the correspondents in many of the subgroups and series within the gubernatorial papers. This card file is located in the library's reading room. In addition, Nancy Williams and her staff compiled an extensive and detailed run of scrapbooks covering the Williams years. There is a separate inventory to these scrapbooks in a separately bound volume.</p>
      <p>Strategy for Use of the Gubernatorial Papers: Although the Williams gubernatorial collection consists of hundreds of linear feet of material, the file arrangement created by the governor's staff is a fairly simple one to understand and to use.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection falls within specific functional groupings, corresponding to the various activities and responsibilities that Williams performed as governor. Thus, if the researcher is uncertain of what portions of the collection might be relevant to his/her research, he/she is advised to think in terms of gubernatorial function. Does the proposed research concern the workings or area responsibility of a state board? If so, the Boards and Commissions series would be the most likely place in which to find material. The election of 1954? Then Democratic Party/Campaign Papers should be first choice. The passage of a specific piece of legislation? Here, Legislative Files is an obvious choice. The possible choices (called subgroups and series) that the researcher has are listed in the Organization of the Collection section. A description of the contents of each of these subgroups/series is provided below.</p>
      <p>If, at first, unsuccessful in finding material on any given topic, the researcher might consider these additional strategies:</p>
      <p>1. Refer to the Williams card index (located in the library's reading room). Sometimes, the name of an individual associated with a subject provides the easiest point of access into the collection. This file is arranged alphabetically and lists the dates of letters between an individual and the governor's office. This file only indexes the larger series and subgroups in the collection. It does not index the staff files, or parts of the Democratic Party/Campaign subgroup. Nevertheless it is an invaluable tool, and can uncover important material otherwise buried.</p>
      <p>2. Refer to the various series of staff papers. Staff members were often closely involved in a specific subject areas (Jordan Popkin and aging, for example) and thus their files are frequently rich in source material.</p>
      <p>3. If only partially successful in locating desired material, the researcher should think of an alternative subgroup or series. The governor's office, for a variety of reasons, often filed related material in different locations depending upon the source of a document. Thus, information relating to a strike might be filed both under the Labor Mediation Board in Boards and Commissions, and Strikes in General Subjects. Furthermore, if the strike influenced a specific piece of legislation, there could be material in the Legislative Files.</p>

          <p>The G. Mennen Williams gubernatorial papers subgroup document Williams' tenure as governor, 1948-1960, and his activities in state and national Democratic Party politics during that period. The subgroup is divided into four series: Chronological, Executive Office, Press Office, Democratic Party, and Miscellaneous</p>
        </scopecontent>

          </did>
          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Chronological series consists primarily of citizen correspondence on a wide variety of subjects, the governor's and staff correspondence and other papers with or concerning state and federal agencies and files relating to legislative affairs. The Chronological series is subdivided by year and then into five broad categories or sub-subseries: General Subjects, Boards and Commissions, Legislative files, Military, and Federal. Within each of the latter categories, there is a more or less standard set of alphabetically arranged subject files for each year.</p>
            <p>The General Subjects sub-subseries are mainly constituent correspondence dealing with a wide range of topics. The file for each year is arranged alphabetically by topic.</p>
            <p>The Boards and Commissions sub-subseries are arranged alphabetically by the name of the state board or commission. In addition, they usually also include files for the elective executive offices (Attorney General, Secretary of State, the Auditor General, etc.) The following types of records may be included for the various boards and commissions: communications with the agency head, audits and other budgetary materials, minutes of meetings, reports, printed matter, and constituent mail. Much of this latter correspondence is of a routine character, and consists of citizen complaints or discussions of personal problems that normally come within the responsibility of a specific state department or commission.</p>
            <p>Legislative Files include constituent correspondence, executive memoranda on pending legislation, copies of the governor's messages to the legislature, statements accompanying bill signings and vetoes, and background material.</p>
            <p>The sub-subseries Military are comprised of files documenting the governor's relationship with the state's military establishment, including the Adjutant General, Quartermaster General, National Guard, State Troops and Civil Defense as well as selective service matters and veterans affairs.</p>
            <p>The Federal sub-subseries consist of correspondence (mainly constituent) with some memoranda and reports. This sub-subseries documents the governor's relationship with federal departments and regulatory agencies. This series also includes correspondence that Williams received relating to federal legislation affecting Michigan.</p>

              <p>The subseries General, 1949-1960, includes staff memoranda; staff follow-up memoranda; governor's mimeographed communications with department heads. It also includes a file of memoranda and reports (arranged alphabetically) relating primarily to appointments or state investigations. These files appear to have been brought together because of their sensitivity.</p>

              <p>The Miscellaneous subseries includes papers on various subjects unfiled at the time Williams left office. It consists, in part, of an arbitrarily created alphabetical sequence, including program projections for the years 1961-1965 that Williams asked the state's department heads to submit. The series also includes a chronological subseries of end-of-administration correspondence, November 1960 to January 1961. Much of this correspondence is of a perfunctory character.</p>

          <p>The G. Mennen Williams Non-Gubernatorial Papers consists of materials documenting the careers, political activities, and personal life of G. Mennen Williams prior to 1949 and since 1960. The subgroup comprises 107 linear feet of materials and contains appointment books, case files, clippings, correspondence, financial records, memoranda, schedules, speeches, student notebooks, and topical files which thoroughly document Williams' non-gubernatorial endeavors.</p>
          <p>As the Williams materials have come to the archives in periodic accessions since 1961, it is natural that little of the original order was preserved. By the time of Williams' death in 1988 what remained of original order consisted of very rough chronological order at some junctures and inconsistent filing by type of material at other points. A decision was made during the 1989 processing of the collection to reorganize the materials. The Non-Gubernatorial papers are divided into seven series reflecting aspects of Williams' career as a public servant, his partisan political activities, and his personal life. The series include: Pre-gubernatorial materials, Undersecretary of State to Africa, Wayne County Equal Employment Opportunity, Ambassador to the Philippines, Michigan Supreme Court, Political, and Personal.</p>

            <p>The Pre-gubernatorial materials series include journals and diaries kept by Williams over the period 1926-1945; class notebooks from Salisbury prep school, Princeton, and University of Michigan Law School; correspondence, including letters from Williams' 1933 trip to Russia; and Democratic Party materials, 1947-1949, mainly relating to his campaign for governor. The materials were part of the earliest accession and have been used frequently by researchers, so they have been preserved in the order created during the original processing.</p>

            <p>The materials covering Williams' tenure as Undersecretary of State for African Affairs comprise twelve linear feet and are arranged alphabetically by type of material. The series includes administrative files, correspondence, a topical file and files relating to Williams' numerous official trips to Africa. An extensive collection of photographs from the African trips and relating to his activities as undersecretary is described in the Visual Material subgroup. The Undersecretary of State materials should be used in conjunction with the microfilm collection of Williams' State Department files, which forms a separate subgroup of the Williams papers.</p>

            <p>The bulk of the Career/Professional group materials detail Williams' terms as a justice on the Michigan Supreme Court. These materials run to 47 linear feet and are arranged alphabetically by type of material. By mutual agreement between the Michigan Historical Collections and the Supreme Court of Michigan, the case files are closed to researchers. Other files in the Supreme Court series document the administration of the Supreme Court and the state court system and Williams' ability as a reformer in modernizing the Michigan courts.</p>

            <p>Materials in the Political series detail Williams' activities in the state and national Democratic parties and provide excellent insight into his campaigns for political office after leaving the governorship. The twelve linear feet of papers in boxes 66-78 are arranged in a rough chronological order with the bulk of the materials relating to his campaigns for the Senate in 1966, and the Michigan Supreme Court in 1970 and 1978. The strength of this group resides in the 1966 Senatorial Election series. These materials provide a day-by-day, county-by-county, look at a consummate campaigner. The people files provide a glimpse into the grassroots organization of the Democratic party in Michigan. This series is nicely complemented by other collections in the Michigan Historical Collection especially the papers of Neil Staebler and Helen Berthelot, and the records of the Democratic Party (Michigan), State Central Committee. Material relating to Williams initial campaign for governor is located in box five and six of the Non-gubernatorial subgroup, while material on subsequent campaigns is located in the Governor's Papers subgroup. (see also boxes 5 and 6 for political materials)</p>

            <p>The materials in the Personal series run to 29 linear feet (boxes 79-107) and cover the years 1883 through 1988 with the bulk of the materials dealing with the last twenty- five years of Williams' life. The materials in this group are arranged by type and then chronologically.</p>
            <p>The Schedules subseries provides a near daily-description of his activities, and the Speeches series manifests his changing attitudes and roles as he moved from statesman to judge. An index of his speeches between 1971 and 1986 is in box 100. Of special interest in the Personal group are those familial papers not created by G. Mennen Williams, but which he preserved. These provide access to the perspectives of Williams' mother and father, and by reflection, show insight into G. Mennen himself. Finally, the personal papers of Nancy Quirk Williams illuminate her crucial roles as wife, mother, co-campaigner, and public liaison for G. Mennen Williams. Some personal material, such as Williams' school notebooks, is included in the Pregubernatorial series, see boxes 1-N - 3-N</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials subgroup includes photographs, color transparencies, caricatures and drawings, films, and videotapes documenting all phases of Williams life and career, but with an emphasis on his years as governor and Undersecretary of State for African Affairs. Owing both to the way in which the collection was received and the manner in which it was initially processed, the visual materials were arranged and described separately from the paper records. The subgroup is arranged in series based on format.</p>

The Principal photograph subseries include Family and Formal Portraits, Gubernatorial activities, Campaigns and Personalities, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Ambassador to the Philippines, and Post-1966. There is also a Miscellaneous subseries of framed photographs which are or have been on display in the library.</p>

            <p>The Films series includes campaign films and television advertisements, actuality footage, documentary footage of ceremonial events which Williams attended or took part in, footage of Williams appearances on television news programs, and several State Department and network television films on Africa, several of which Williams appeared in. This is a preliminary inventory to the films, some identifications are tentative. The arrangement of the inventory is basically chronological. Unless otherwise noted, films are 16mm, b/w, sound. Film numbers follow the description.</p>
            <p>The 16mm films were digitized in 2009 as part of film and video preservation project. A Beta SP master was made of each film along with high resolution digital files (mpeg2) of selected films and DVD and streaming files (flash) of each film. Several films are currently available online as streaming video. Other files can be mounted by request.</p>

            <p>The Videotape Masters series is principally made up of the 2-inch masters of the campaign ads duplicated to VHS format and listed in the Videotapes - use copy series. There are two master tapes of political rallies at which Robert Kennedy appeared in support of Williams' 1966 senatorial campaign. Also included here is a 3/4-inch copy of the "Le manifestations du 22 Septembre 1965" apparently dubbed from the 35 mm film.</p>
            <p>The two-inch videotapes were digitized in 2009 as part of film and video preservation project. A Beta SP master was made of each film along with high resolution digital files (mpeg2) of selected films and DVD and streaming files (flash) of each film. Several films are currently available online as streaming video. Other files can be mounted by request.</p>

          <p>G. Mennen Williams served as Undersecretary of State for African Affairs from 1961-1966. In 1974, the U.S. State Department, upon request of the Michigan Historical Collections and Governor G. Mennen Williams, consented to microfilm the files of the department of African affairs during the period when Williams was assistant secretary. The procedure followed prior to microfilming is described in the memorandum from State Department officer W. Witman, which is available at the library. The result of the project is 23 microfilm reels of materials covering the period, 1960-1966.</p>
          <p>The researcher should be alerted to certain problems in the use of these films not fully described in the Witman memorandum. First, relatively little processing was done on the files before filming. Several reels appear to be filmed in random order. The difficulty is compounded because the film came without a meaningful inventory. Reels were described in a general manner (either "trips" or chronological") but there were no internal targets to aid the researcher. Finally, of the materials labeled as chronological, the files were filmed with the latest date first. The researcher wanting to examine files chronologically will thus have to begin at the end of a reel and work his/her way forward.</p>
          <p>The collection has four recognizable series plus a number of miscellaneous reels. Series I is a 1964. chronological file covering the period 1961-1966, with a gap of July 1963 to December 1964. Series II is also a chronological series. Consisting of copies of the Secretary's outgoing letters, this series is of a more personal nature and includes thank you letters and letters of congratulation. This series also has a gap of July 1963 to December 1964. Series III is the files of the Secretary's special assistants, primarily John T. Abernethy, but also including Edward J. Chesky and Alexander L. Wiener, Jr. Series IV relates to Governor Williams' several trips through Africa. Series V is miscellaneous.</p>
