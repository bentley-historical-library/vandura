    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>(Hugh) Gardner Ackley was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on June 30, 1915. In 1936, Ackley received his baccalaureate degree from Western State Teachers College (now Western Michigan University) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In 1937, a master's degree was conferred upon Ackley by the University of Michigan and in 1940 he received a doctoral degree from the same institution.</p>
      <p>In 1939 and 1940, Ackley was an instructor at Ohio State University, returning to teach at the University of Michigan in late 1940. Throughout the Second World War he served as a member of the government in Washington. From 1941 to 1942, and again from 1944 to 1946 he worked at the Office of Price Administration. In 1943 and 1944 he was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services. Concluding his wartime service, Mr. Ackley returned to the University of Michigan where he resumed his academic career in the Department of Economics.</p>
      <p>Ackley returned to government service in 1951, serving for two years as the assistant director of the Office of Price Stabilization. After completing this assignment he once again returned to Ann Arbor to carry on scholarly pursuits.</p>
      <p>Gardner Ackley left Ann Arbor for Washington for the third time in August 1962 when President John Kennedy named him as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors. He served as a member of the council until November 14, 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson named him the new chairman of the CEA. Early in 1968, Mr. Ackley left the council to become ambassador to Italy, a post he held until 1969. After returning from Italy, Ackley again resumed his academic career at the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>From 1969 until 1984 Ackley was the Henry Carter Adams University Professor of Political Economy at the University of Michigan. During this same period, he served on many national commissions and councils devoted to economic issues. He was a member of the Trilateral Commission from 1977 to 1983 and during 1978-1979 he was a member of the Advisory Council on Social Security. He also served as president of the American Economics Association during 1982.</p>
      <p>Among his many honors, Ackley received the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award at the University of Michigan in 1976 and he was also elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science. Ackley has been professor emeritus since 1984.</p>
      <p>Gardner Ackley died February 12, 1998.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Gardner Ackley papers document the career of one of the most influential economists of his time. As a researcher, teacher, and especially as an advisor to United States presidents and various government agencies Ackley helped formulate the direction of governmental economic policy. This collection reflects those activities. Ackley's papers arrived at the Bentley Library in four accessions: 1972 (boxes 1-23), 1988 (boxes 24-28), 2005 (boxes 29-36), and 2011 (boxes 37-38). Generally, papers from the first accession relate to his earlier career, those from the 1988 accession relate to his later career, and those from 2005 from all phases of his professional life. The 2011 accession consists mainly of photographs and other personal materials.</p>
      <p>The collection is divided into twelve series: Office of Price Administration/Office of Price Stabilization files; President's Council of Economic Advisors files; University of Michigan files; Professional Correspondence; Meetings and Conferences; Speeches, Journal Articles, Letters to the Editor, Chronological correspondence, Clipping file, Columns and unpublished writings, US Ambassador to Italy, 1968-1969, Later career, and Personal: Photographs, Scrapbooks, etc.</p>

          <p>Office of Price Administration/Office of Price Stabilization. Those interested in Ackley's activities during World War II should consult folders under "Office of Price Administration". In addition to analyses of price levels of specific commodities during World War II these files contain studies of war profits of major American corporations. Ackley left the Office of Price Administration in 1946 but returned there in 1951. By that time, the agency had been renamed the Office of Price Stabilization. Hence, Office of Price Stabilization files for the years 1951-1953 contain similar material to the earlier Office of Price Administration files. Speeches and articles by Ackley during the early 1950s are also included under "Office of Price Stabilization".</p>

          <p>The President's Council of Economic Advisors series documents Ackley's various activities within the council first as a member and then as chairman. This series is further divided into a number of sub-series. These sub-series are described here in the order in which they appear in the contents list. To begin, "Topical Files" are alphabetically arranged and document a wide range of economic and political subjects of interest to the council. The largest of the sub-series, "Speeches and Presentations", is chronologically arranged and includes speeches by Ackley at various functions. In most cases, the location and title of the speech is included as part of the folder title. Transcripts of interviews with Ackley on television and radio precede another large sub-series, "Meetings of the CEA". The meetings are subdivided into cabinet, governmental and non-governmental meetings. All three types are chronologically arranged and a brief description of the subject of the meeting is usually included in the contents list. A sub-series of "Memoranda" follows. Memoranda is divided into memos to the President, general memos, and memos to the White House staff. Each of these groups is chronologically arranged. Topics of the memoranda are only rarely included in the contents list. The "Correspondence" sub-series follows and is alphabetically arranged by correspondent. "News Media Articles, Interviews and Invitations" concludes the CEA series. News articles are arranged alphabetically by the name of the newspaper or magazine.</p>
          <p>In 1976, a positive microfilm copy of portions of Gardner Ackley's Council of Economic Advisors papers (boxes 5-18 (part)) was filmed for the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library. The Bentley Library retains the negative microfilm (box 23). The donor requested that no additional copies of the film be made without his permission.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan series is alphabetically arranged by subject. About half of this material pertains to lecture notes and exams for courses which Ackley taught. The rest of this series includes drafts of speeches, journal articles, and book reviews which were written while Ackley was a professor of economics at the University of Michigan. In addition, Ackley's files relating to his participation on the Rackham Review Committee (1974-1976) are included in this series. Miscellaneous correspondence with the Economics Department and with the University of Michigan is also included.</p>

          <p>The Chronological correspondence series dates from late 1964 to early 1968 and documents the period when Gardner Ackley was a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. This file consists of copies of outgoing correspondence only. As these files fall within the period when Ackley was a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the researcher should also consult that series (boxes 4-18) for complementary materials.</p>
