      <p>Music instruction at the University of Michigan was established by the Board of Regents on the recommendation of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1880, making it one of the first universities in the country to offer such instruction. Calvin B. Cady was the first instructor and commenced lessons in 1881, offering a theoretic and scientific course in music. He established the Ann Arbor School of Music (AASM) in 1881 to give private lessons to supplement his university income. In 1885 Cady became a professor; he resigned in 1888.</p>
      <p>The University Musical Society was also founded in 1880. The purpose of the society was to stimulate musical appreciation in the university and community. Dr. Frieze, then acting university president, was instrumental in founding the society and university presidents served as presidents of the society well into the twentieth century. In 1881, the recently founded AASM became a division of the University Musical Society and degrees were conferred by the society. The school carried out instruction and concerts in cooperation with the society.</p>
      <p>Albert A. Stanley took over the professorship of music and became director of the University Musical Society in 1888. The Ann Arbor and university communities helped the ailing school and society by holding a series of events and fundraisers in the early 1890s. The AASM was reorganized as the University School of Music (USM) in 1892; the University Musical Society continued to administer the school. After reorganization, $15,000 was raised by the School of Music Building Association to erect a building to house the school on Maynard Street. In 1896, the first commencement exercises were held at the school, with nine graduates participating. Two years later Frederick Stearns donated one of the largest collections of old and exotic instruments in the country to the USM.</p>
      <p>The role of the USM expanded in 1905 when a resolution was adopted by the Board of Regents permitting students in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts to elect USM courses in practical music and receive credit. In 1929, the school became a unit of the university, with degrees granted directly by the university, rather than the University Musical Society. The school continued to be administered by the University Musical Society board of directors, but matters of policy and principle were now subject to the approval of the University of Michigan Board of Regents. Title to real estate held by the Musical Society passed to the university which made an annual appropriation to assist in payment of expenses for the school. A master of music program was added to the curriculum in 1929.</p>
      <p>In 1933, election of the Musical Society's board of directors became subject to regental approval. In 1940, the school became an autonomous unit of the university and separated completely from the University Musical Society. All instructors and professors were put on salary and no longer received commissions from private lessons. The University Musical Society retained the privilege of giving concerts in university buildings and was allowed space for their administrative functions in the Burton Memorial Tower.</p>
      <p>In 1922, Earl V. Moore became the director of the Musical Society and school. In 1946, he became the first dean of the University of Michigan School of Music, serving in this capacity until 1960. In 1940, enrollment in the school stood at 303 students with 40 faculty members. Seventy-two concerts were given in 1940. In 1945, the curriculum was expanded to include a doctor of philosophy degree in musicology and music education and a doctor of education degree in music education. In the 1950s, the study of music history was enhanced by the acquisition of the famous Stellfeld Collection of music, including manuscripts of 17th and 18th century composers. In 1953, a doctor of musical arts degree was created providing a professional degree in composition and performance. By 1960 enrollment had increased to 500 students with 50 graduate students and a teaching staff of 59. In 1960, James Wallace became dean and served until 1970, when he was replaced by Allen Britton.</p>
      <p>The growing numbers of students created space problems for the school. In 1964, a new building designed by architect Eero Saarinen was dedicated on north campus. Prior to moving into the new building, the school had been housed in 13 buildings scattered throughout campus. In 1975, the name of the building was changed to the Earl V. Moore Building in honor of the distinguished dean. The Margaret Dow Towsley Center, an addition to the Moore Building, was dedicated in 1985. The Center contains a Vocal Arts Center, Organ Recital Studio, and Stearns Collection exhibit rooms and was the result of a capital campaign begun in 1980 to raise funds for the school.</p>
      <p>In 1971, a doctor of philosophy in theory was added to the curriculum and a bachelor of musical arts in 1973. By the 1972-1973 school year, the School of Music was composed of 106 faculty members and 861 students, including 274 graduate students. The school expanded in the 1970s with the addition of a dance department. Programs in composition and performance were enhanced by the building of one of the five best electronic music studios in the western hemisphere. By the end of the decade the diversity of the school could be seen in its many departments: Music History/Musicology, Conducting, Theory, String, Organ, Dance, Piano, Music Education, Composition, Voice, and Wind and Percussion Instruments. In 1980, Paul Boylan became dean of the school.</p>
      <p>The first official university band was organized in 1935. It performed at athletic events and gave occasional concerts. By the 1960s there were six university bands (Symphony, Concert, Marching, Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Varsity, and Jazz). The bands are under the direction of School of Music faculty. The Marching Band has gained fame in recognition of its quality and precision in performance which have been highlighted during performances on televised football games. In 1972 the William D. Revelli Band Hall was dedicated, named in honor of the distinguished university band director.</p>
      <p>Vocal music has also been a priority of the school; the first choir was established in 1942 and the chamber choir in 1965. The Men's and Women's Glee Clubs, the Arts Chorale, and Michigan Singers have also provided a training ground for young musicians and vocalists at the university.</p>

          <p>The Topical File series is comprised of two separate alphabetical files. The first, received in the early accessions of School of Music records, covers the years 1891-1982. The second, received in 2005, covers the years 1962-1999.</p>

            <p>The majority of the files in the School of Music Topical Files, 1891-1982 subseries (5.0 linear feet) document the School of Music after 1940, when it became an autonomous unit of the University of Michigan. The majority of these files are comprised of the minutes of faculty meetings (1942-1952, 1957-1983), and executive committee meetings (1946-1951, 1960-1987). These minutes and the Faculty Communications files (1957-1979) along with the Regents Communications files (1926-1929, 1953-1981) are good sources for documenting school activities and development of administration policies.</p>
            <p>The early years of the School of Music are sparingly documented. The Reports, 1880 file contains (copies of) the original reports drafted to the Board of Regents requesting a professorship in music and the regents response to the request. The materials in the Building Association file document the issuing of bonds to build the Maynard Street structure in 1893. The Student Ledgers, an incomplete run from 1881 to 1940, list student names, tuition, and instructors.</p>
            <p>Other documentation pertains to student performance groups, School of Music buildings, and efforts to raise funds for the school. The documentation of student groups mostly consists of correspondence for tour and performance arrangements and does not address the creative process. Much of the material relates to the University Band from 1924 to 1953, including correspondence and clippings. There is Michigan Singers correspondence from 1953 to 1962, and Union Opera news releases, correspondence, and clippings from 1951 to 1956. In the 1956/57 school year the Union Opera became coeducational and changed its name to Musket. There are Musket news releases, minutes, and correspondence from 1956 to 1962. The Men's and Women's Glee Clubs files consist of correspondence relating to touring and performances. The International Center files (1956-1961) document spring tours given around Michigan by international students to increase appreciation for diverse cultures. Photographs of student performance groups are found in the Student Touring Organizations Scrapbook which dates from the 1950s.</p>
            <p>There are several files related to the funding and building of School of Music buildings. The conception and planning process for the Earl V. Moore Building is documented in the New Building files, which include news clippings and a drawing of the old school of music building on Maynard Street before it was razed in 1965.</p>
            <p>The capital campaign files document a three-year campaign to expand facilities, to develop a sound recording laboratory, to build an institute for advanced studies in music, and to establish a residential string quartet. The campaign was part of a university-wide fund-raising drive begun in 1980 and active through 1983. The School of Music tied the campaign into their centennial celebration entitled "For Century II." The Development Committee minutes, and Development of Public Relations files document additional fund-raising efforts of the school.</p>

          <p>The Archived Website series (2002-2008, 2.13 GB; 2010-[ONGOING]) documents the academic programs, accomplishments, resources, events, and people at the School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance. Content includes important news and announcements, publications (such as newsletters and student handbooks), and information about departments, admissions, curriculum, degree requirements, performances, faculty, alumni relations, special youth and adult programs, and the overall mission of the School. The series is arranged chronologically and includes content captured by the Internet Archive starting in 1996 as well as captures provided by Bentley Library archivists in 2002, 2003, 2006 and ca. 2008. Starting in 2010, this archived website will be captured on a regular, ongoing basis as part of the University of Michigan Web Archives, hosted at http://webarchives.cdlib.org/a/universityofmichigan/</p>
