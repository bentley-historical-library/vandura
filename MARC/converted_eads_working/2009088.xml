    <scopecontent>The bulk of the collection consists of student memorabilia collected by Sarah (Sally) Wandell Waite while attending the University of Michigan from 1908/09 to 1911/12. There are also some materials from various years following her graduation up to 1979. Of particular note are her dance cards, including a dance card from a Michigamua "Peace Dance" in 1910. Another interesting item is a University of Michigan hat pin bearing the old 1837 university seal. Also included are Alumni Association membership materials, blue book exams, class notes, graduation programs, photographs, Pi Beta Phi fraternity materials, a University Bulletin containing instructions on teaching observations, pins and ribbons, a University calendar, and theater programs.</scopecontent>
