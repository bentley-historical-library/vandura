    <bioghist>Rev. James Billings was a Universalist minister, editor, publisher, and missionary. In 1843 he edited, with others, the Ann Arbor, Mich. religious publication "The Primitive Expounder." In 1844 he was one of the founders of the Alphadelphia Association, a commune near Galesburg, Mich. (disbanded in 1848). Between 1844 and 1846 Billings published "Alphadelphia Tocsin," commune's newsletter. Approximately in 1845 Billings moved to Jackson, Mich. Nathaniel Stacy (1778-1868) was a Universalist clergyman and evangelist active in New York, Western Pennsylvania, and Michigan Territory, where he helped organize Michigan's first Universalist association and headed the church in Ann Arbor, approximately in 1835-1840.</bioghist>
