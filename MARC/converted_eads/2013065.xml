    <bioghist>William L. Fink (1896-1992) was a 1921 engineering graduate of the University of Michigan (Ph.D. 1926). He began working at the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) in 1925, and became Chief of the Physical Metallurgy Division in 1943.</bioghist>
    <scopecontent>The collection consists of an oral history interview with William L. Fink conducted by Carolyn Felton. The interview relates to growing up in Indiana. The Fink family were very interested in automobiles and Fink talks about an early auto that was built by his grandfather and some of the early road practices of operating an automobile. He learned to drive when he was six years old and attended the first Indianapolis 500. He also tells of watching Wilbur and Orville Wright demonstrate an airplane.</scopecontent>
