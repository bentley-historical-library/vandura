    <bioghist>Beavais is a researcher and collector of materials, relating in part to his family and to the careers of University of Michigan graduates of interest to him.</bioghist>
    <scopecontent>Photocopies of documents, including newspaper clippings, State Dept. files, and references to Ralph Lawrence Neafus in books and periodicals. Neafus was a 1936 graduate of the University of Michigan School of Forestry and Conservation. In 1937 he enlisted in the Spanish Loyalist International Brigades and fought in Spain with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. In 1938 he was captured and apparently executed by Spanish Nationalists. Some of the materials relate to University of Michigan campus reaction to his disappearance. Beauvais also collected material relating to his grandfather Albert D. Walton, a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, class of 1907. The Walton files include copies of materials from various repositories relating to his career as a New York and Wyoming attorney.</scopecontent>
