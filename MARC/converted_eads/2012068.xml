    <bioghist>The Ann Arbor Polish Film Festival is an annual cultural event organized by the Polish Cultural Fund-Ann Arbor in cooperation with the Polish-American Congress Ann Arbor Chapter, the University of Michigan's Polish Club, and the University of Michigan. Since its beginning in 1993, the Festival has promoted Polish culture by offering audiences an opportunity to see a broad range of narrative forms and visual styles present in contemporary Polish cinema, including documentaries, animated shorts, and feature films. These works are not only commentaries on life in contemporary Poland, but also reflect the views of Polish artists interpreting diverse issues around the world.</bioghist>
    <scopecontent>The collection includes program announcement flyers, newsletters, posters, and related material; also DVD of Ewa Pieta talking about Polish films with clips; and CD-Rs of documents, primarily announcements and news notes.</scopecontent>
