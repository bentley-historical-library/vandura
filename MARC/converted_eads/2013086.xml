    <bioghist>Born February 24, 1919 in Detroit, Michigan, to Mandel and Dora (Kaplan) Leibovitz; legally changed surname in 1946. Received A.B. and M.A. from the University of Michigan and taught in Detroit Public Schools before 1943 induction to U.S. Army. Fluent in French, German, and Yiddish, Mandell served as an interpreter with infantry deployed to France, Germany, and Central Europe. Following the surrender of Germany, Mandell was responsible for helping displaced persons and political prisoners return to their countries of origin. Mandell was discharged in 1946 and returned to Detroit where he married and raised a family. He died November 2, 1991.</bioghist>
