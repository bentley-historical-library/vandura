    <bioghist>Ann Arbor Chapter of The Polish American Congress was established in 1970 as an independent Chapter of Michigan Division of the Polish American Congress. The Polish American Congress serves as the umbrella for majority of Polish organizations in the United States and in Michigan. Ann Arbor Chapter's mission is to interact in the community through civic, social, cultural and educational initiatives to promote Polish ancestry and increase other cultures' understanding of Polish people. There are about 60 members and supporters in PAC-Ann Arbor, most of them live or work in Ann Arbor area and other parts of Washtenaw County. The PACAAC works in partnership with several local organizations including the University of Michigan Polish Club, Polish Cultural Fund and Kiwanis Club of Ann Arbor.</bioghist>
    <scopecontent>"Ann Arbor Polish Americans" is an oral history project conducted by the Polish American Congress Ann Arbor Chapter (PACAAC), a non-profit organization. The project was administered by Malgosia Myc (PACAAC archivist) and is focusing on the PAC Ann Arbor Chapter members. The purpose of these interviews was to capture their immigration experience and to provide the information about the history of the PACAAC since its beginnings and the life of the Polish community in Ann Arbor in general. Some interviews include the memories from the life in Poland (including World War II). Each interview folder consists of a CD (audio), as well as a typed transcript of the interview, signed releases and a photograph/s of an interviewee.</scopecontent>
