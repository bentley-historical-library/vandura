    <bioghist>Vivienne Dow and her husband Alex Dow participated actively on an advisory committee addressing development of the university's Arboretum. Although Vivienne Dow was not formally affiliated with the university, she was invited to participate by Wilfred B. Shaw, Director of the university Bureau of Alumni Relations. Dow's husband, Alex Dow, born in Scotland in 1862, was a highly prominent mechanical engineer in the United States by virtue of his involvement with electrical companies in Detroit, especially Detroit Edison, of which he was later president. He received two honorary degrees from the University of Michigan.</bioghist>
