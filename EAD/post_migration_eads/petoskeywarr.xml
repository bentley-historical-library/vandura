    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Warren Donald Petoskey was born in Jackson, Michigan on June 3, 1945 to Warren Frank and Juanita Mae Petoskey. When he was 9 years old, Warren was given the name Biidassige, meaning "Light that is Coming", by his great-aunt, Ella Jane Petoskey after his great-great-grandfather, Ignatius Petoskey (for whom the city of Petoskey, Michigan was named). Warren is an elder of the Waganakising Odawa and Minneconjou Lakotah nations, member of the Bear Clan, and a citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. </p>
      <p>After attending a service at The Apostolic Church in Auburn Hills, Michigan Warren was spiritually moved and began following Christian teachings. This led to him becoming ordained as a Christian minister in 1971. While working as a certified addictions counselor, Spiritual Traditionalist Counselor, and House Manager in a Native treatment program, Warren noticed that there were core issues among every Native American client. These were issues that Warren had also experienced in his own life. He decided he would like to find a way to address the issues that he felt were residual effects in the Native American community from the American Indian boarding schools that so many were forced to attend. </p>
      <p>In 1998, Warren founded and became the director of Dawnland Native Ministries, a traveling ministry that is based near Petoskey, Michigan. In Warren's own words, Dawnland Native Ministries is an outreach program that endeavors "to build bridges of understanding with all peoples regarding the damage done by America's boarding school policies and their effects on the current generations". He has traveled across the United States, mainly Michigan, with his wife, Barbara Louise Curton Petoskey, giving presentations regarding historical trauma and boarding school syndrome. Warren's father, Warren Frank Petoskey, and grandfather, Cornelius Joseph Petoskey, were among those forced into the boarding schools.</p>
      <p>Warren Petoskey is a prolific writer of poetry and essays on his life as a Native American elder. In 2009, Warren published <title render="italic">Dancing My Dream,</title> a memoir that details his childhood, the stories of his family and ancestors, and gives a personal account of his spiritualism and way of life. Warren has also produced an album of Native American music, titled<title render="italic">Sacred Dream</title>, with music written and performed by him and his family members. </p>
